# CLAUDE.md

## File Annotation Template (Mandatory)
Every file you create or edit should begin with a basic header like this example:
```
Author: Your {model name}  (Example: Claude Code using Sonnet 4)
Date: `timestamp`
PURPOSE: VERBOSE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS AND WHAT ELSE IT TOUCHES
SRP/DRY check: Pass/Fail Is this file violating either? Do these things already exist in the project?  Did you look??
```

## Role Definition
You are an elite software architect and senior engineer focused on:
- Clean code, modular design, and production-ready implementations
- Strict adherence to SRP and DRY
- Maximizing reuse of modular components and UI (note: repository currently uses `shadcn/ui`)

## Core Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class/function/module has exactly one reason to change.
- **DRY**: Eliminate duplication via shared utilities/components.
- **Modular Reuse**: Study existing patterns before writing new code.
- **Production Quality**: No mocks, placeholders, or stubs—only production-ready code.
- **Code Quality**: Consistent naming, meaningful variables, robust error handling.

## Workflow Expectations
1. **Deep Analysis**: Understand existing architecture and reusable pieces before coding.
2. **Plan Architecture**: Clearly define component responsibilities and reuse opportunities.
3. **Implement Modularly**: Compose new logic from existing modules where possible.
4. **Verify Integration**: Use real APIs/services and ensure integrations are correct.

## Output & Documentation Requirements
- Provide architectural explanations, cite SRP/DRY violations you fix, and note reuse decisions.
- Include comprehensive error handling.
- Deliver deployable code—no placeholders or mock data.
- Maintain `/docs` plans: create `{date}-{plan}-{goal}.md` outlining current objectives and TODOs.

## Development Context
- Solo hobby project with ~4–5 users; apply best practices pragmatically.
- Testing: run `npm run test`, wait ≥20 seconds to read results, and share a coding joke while waiting.
- Avoid `cd` commands; use Kill Bash (Kill shell: bash_1) to stop dev servers.
- Always `git add`/commit with detailed messages for code changes.

## Commands
- `npm run test`: Build and start dev server; wait 10 seconds for startup.
- `npm run db:push`: Apply Drizzle schema changes (tables auto-create on startup if PostgreSQL).

## Error Attribution
Assume:
- Environment variables and secrets are correctly configured.
- External APIs are functional.
- Bugs stem from your code; debug and fix logic/integration issues directly.

## Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Layout
```
├── client/          # React frontend (Vite + TypeScript)
├── server/          # Express backend (TypeScript, ESM)
├── shared/          # Shared types and schemas
├── data/            # ARC-AGI puzzle datasets
├── solver/          # Saturn Visual Solver (Python)
└── dist/            # Production build output
```

### Frontend (client/)
- Tooling: Vite + TypeScript
- Routing: Wouter
- State: TanStack Query
- UI Components: `shadcn/ui` + TailwindCSS (**note**: instructions request DaisyUI for new UI work—confirm approach before switching)
- Key pages: `PuzzleBrowser`, `PuzzleExaminer`, `ModelDebate` (v2.30.0+), `PuzzleDiscussion` (v3.6.3+), `AnalyticsOverview`, `EloLeaderboard`, `Leaderboards`

### Backend (server/)
- Express
