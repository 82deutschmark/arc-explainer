# ARC-AGI Puzzle Examination Tool

## Overview

This is an interactive web application for examining ARC-AGI (Abstract Reasoning Corpus - Artificial General Intelligence) puzzles to understand abstract reasoning patterns. The application presents puzzles as grids with space-themed emoji representations, treating them as alien communication patterns that humans can study. Rather than solving puzzles, users examine training examples alongside correct test answers to understand the underlying logic. The system provides AI-powered pattern analysis to help decode the alien communication rules.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with a clear separation between client and server:

**Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- Modern React application using Vite as the build tool
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Tailwind CSS for styling with shadcn/ui component library
- React Query (TanStack Query) for state management and API interactions
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

**Backend (Express + TypeScript)**
- Express.js server with TypeScript support
- RESTful API design for puzzle operations
- OpenAI integration for puzzle analysis and solution validation
- In-memory storage with extensible storage interface

**Database Layer**
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- Schema defined for user management
- Database migrations support via Drizzle Kit

## Key Components

### Frontend Components

1. **PuzzleGrid** - Displays interactive grids with emoji representations
2. **PuzzleViewer** - Main puzzle interface with training examples and test cases  
3. **HintSystem** - Progressive hint revelation system with emoji legend
4. **PuzzleSolver** - Main page component orchestrating the puzzle-solving experience

### Backend Services

1. **Puzzle Analyzer** - Validates grid consistency and analyzes puzzle patterns
2. **OpenAI Service** - Integrates with GPT-4o for pattern analysis and solution validation
3. **Storage Interface** - Abstracted storage layer supporting multiple implementations
4. **Route Handlers** - RESTful endpoints for puzzle operations

### Shared Types

- **ARCTask** - Defines puzzle structure with training and test examples
- **PuzzleAnalysis** - AI-generated analysis with patterns and strategies
- **SolutionValidation** - Feedback system for user solutions

## Data Flow

1. **Puzzle Loading**: Client requests puzzle data from `/api/puzzle/task/:id`
2. **AI Analysis**: Server analyzes puzzle patterns using OpenAI API
3. **User Interaction**: Interactive grid allows users to modify solutions
4. **Solution Validation**: User solutions validated against correct answers
5. **Feedback Loop**: Real-time feedback provided to guide learning

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/react-*** - Accessible UI primitives for components
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Server state management and caching
- **tailwindcss** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **wouter** - Minimalist routing library
- **date-fns** - Date manipulation utilities

### Backend Dependencies
- **express** - Web application framework
- **drizzle-orm** - Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@neondatabase/serverless** - Serverless PostgreSQL driver
- **openai** - Official OpenAI API client
- **connect-pg-simple** - PostgreSQL session store

### Development Tools
- **vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **typescript** - Static type checking
- **drizzle-kit** - Database migration and schema management
- **esbuild** - JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

**Development Environment**
- Vite development server with hot module replacement
- Express server with TypeScript compilation via tsx
- Environment variable configuration for API keys and database URLs

**Production Build**
- Vite builds optimized client-side bundle to `dist/public`
- esbuild compiles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving integrated with Express server
- Single deployment artifact containing both client and server

**Database Strategy**
- PostgreSQL as primary database (configurable via DATABASE_URL)
- Drizzle migrations for schema evolution
- In-memory storage fallback for development/testing

**Environment Configuration**
- `NODE_ENV` for environment detection
- `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI service integration
- Replit-specific optimizations for cloud deployment
