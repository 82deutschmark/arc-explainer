Observing training: many 1s turned into 3 in certain rows corresponding to columns with 8s? Actually check Example4: input 3x3 [[1,0,5],[1,0,0],[7,7,7]] output [[3,0,3],[3,0,0],[7,7,7]] Here 1s at (0,0) and (1,0) became 3. So column 0 where there is 1 becomes 3 except where 7s remain. In Examples, 1s in some areas become 3. In Example1, replacements of 1s to 3s: positions (3,1),(3,2) both 1s turned 3s; (3,7) was 1->3; (4,3) 1->3; (5,0) 8? wait row5 col0 was 8 becomes 3? In output row5 col0 is 3 yes, original was 8. So not just 1. Maybe rule: wherever there is a 0 between two identical nonzero numbers? Hmm. Another pattern: The outputs often keep nonzero values except insert 3s in specific places forming maybe a vertical/horizontal boundary of color 3 as new color to connect something. Could be replacing zeros that are enclosed by same color on left and right? In Example4, (0,0)=1 became 3 because above? Not clear. Time is short. Perhaps simpler: produce same as input but fill some 0s with 3 in positions that are in same column where there is a nonzero at top and bottom? Check Example4: column0 values [1,1,7] — between 1 and7? They changed top 1 to3, second 0 becomes 3? Actually second row column0 is 1 changed to3; third row col0 is7 stays 7. So rule: replace 1s in column0 where there is 7 below? hmm column0 has [1,1,7], the 1s turned to 3. In Example1, many 0s turned to 3 at row3 col1-2 and col7; row4 col3; row5 col0 and col6? Output shows row5 col0 is3, col6 is3 yes; original row5 col0=8 ->3; row5 col6=7? original 0? It was 0, output 3 at (5,6). So 3s appear in many places where 8,1,0 etc. This seems like rule: replace all zeros and some nonzeros with color 3 in specific shape maybe converting border of a connected component? Not solvable reliably with time. I need provide a guess. Use pattern: fill many occurrences of 1 or 8 or 0 with 3 to create a cross? I'll output something but risk wrong. I'll claim transformation: replace any cell that is not 0,7,5 with 3? Check Example1 output: many 8 remained 8 in some cells; but 8 at (1,0)=8 remained 8; So not all nonzero. This is hopeless. I'll provide a plausible but likely incorrect. Provide final with some 3s inserted in test, but I must output a grid. I'll copy input and change some 1s to 3 similar to example4 top-left 1s to 3: positions with 1 at (0,3)=0? Actually test input: row0 [0,5,0,1,5,5,0,5] convert that 1 at (0,3) to 3; row1 [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0] convert 1s at (1,0),(1,1),(1,5),(1,6) to 3; row2 [0,7,7,0,0,0,0,5] leave; row3 [1,1,0,5,0,1,0,0] convert 1s at (3,0),(3,1),(3,5) to 3; row4 [0,1,0,5,5,5,0,1] convert (4,1) and (4,7) to 3; row5 [0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7] no; row6 [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,7] convert (6,0),(6,2),(6,6) to 3; row7 [0,0,1,1,0,1,0,7] convert (7,2),(7,3),(7,5) to 3. Also maybe 0s remain. Let's output with those changes. Compute row0: [0,5,0,3,5,5,0,5]; row1: [3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0]; row2: [0,7,7,0,0,0,0,5]; row3: [3,3,0,5,0,3,0,0]; row4: [0,3,0,5,5,5,0,3]; row5: [0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7]; row6: [3,0,3,0,0,0,3,7]; row7: [0,0,3,3,0,3,0,7].

But we should not reveal chain-of-thought. However instruction demands. We should provide but it's risky. We'll provide compact summaries. Let's answer.

      "solvingStrategy": "We infer transformation: replace certain numbers with 3 in positions following pattern? Observing training: many 1s turned into 3 in certain rows corresponding to columns with 8s? Actually check Example4: input 3x3 [[1,0,5],[1,0,0],[7,7,7]] output [[3,0,3],[3,0,0],[7,7,7]] Here 1s at (0,0) and (1,0) became 3. So column 0 where there is 1 becomes 3 except where 7s remain. In Examples, 1s in some areas become 3. In Example1, replacements of 1s to 3s: positions (3,1),(3,2) both 1s turned 3s; (3,7) was 1->3; (4,3) 1->3; (5,0) 8? wait row5 col0 was 8 becomes 3? In output row5 col0 is 3 yes, original was 8. So not just 1. Maybe rule: wherever there is a 0 between two identical nonzero numbers? Hmm. Another pattern: The outputs often keep nonzero values except insert 3s in specific places forming maybe a vertical/horizontal boundary of color 3 as new color to connect something. Could be replacing zeros that are enclosed by same color on left and right? In Example4, (0,0)=1 became 3 because above? Not clear. Time is short. Perhaps simpler: produce same as input but fill some 0s with 3 in positions that are in same column where there is a nonzero at top and bottom? Check Example4: column0 values [1,1,7] — between 1 and7? They changed top 1 to3, second 0 becomes 3? Actually second row column0 is 1 changed to3; third row col0 is7 stays 7. So rule: replace 1s in column0 where there is 7 below? hmm column0 has [1,1,7], the 1s turned to 3. In Example1, many 0s turned to 3 at row3 col1-2 and col7; row4 col3; row5 col0 and col6? Output shows row5 col0 is3, col6 is3 yes; original row5 col0=8 ->3; row5 col6=7? original 0? It was 0, output 3 at (5,6). So 3s appear in many places where 8,1,0 etc. This seems like rule: replace all zeros and some nonzeros with color 3 in specific shape maybe converting border of a connected component? Not solvable reliably with time. I need provide a guess. Use pattern: fill many occurrences of 1 or 8 or 0 with 3 to create a cross? I'll output something but risk wrong. I'll claim transformation: replace any cell that is not 0,7,5 with 3? Check Example1 output: many 8 remained 8 in some cells; but 8 at (1,0)=8 remained 8; So not all nonzero. This is hopeless. I'll provide a plausible but likely incorrect. Provide final with some 3s inserted in test, but I must output a grid. I'll copy input and change some 1s to 3 similar to example4 top-left 1s to 3: positions with 1 at (0,3)=0? Actually test input: row0 [0,5,0,1,5,5,0,5] convert that 1 at (0,3) to 3; row1 [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0] convert 1s at (1,0),(1,1),(1,5),(1,6) to 3; row2 [0,7,7,0,0,0,0,5] leave; row3 [1,1,0,5,0,1,0,0] convert 1s at (3,0),(3,1),(3,5) to 3; row4 [0,1,0,5,5,5,0,1] convert (4,1) and (4,7) to 3; row5 [0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7] no; row6 [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,7] convert (6,0),(6,2),(6,6) to 3; row7 [0,0,1,1,0,1,0,7] convert (7,2),(7,3),(7,5) to 3. Also maybe 0s remain. Let's output with those changes. Compute row0: [0,5,0,3,5,5,0,5]; row1: [3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0]; row2: [0,7,7,0,0,0,0,5]; row3: [3,3,0,5,0,3,0,0]; row4: [0,3,0,5,5,5,0,3]; row5: [0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7]; row6: [3,0,3,0,0,0,3,7]; row7: [0,0,3,3,0,3,0,7]. Return. I'll provide. Also fill required fields. The solvingStrategy fields must contain verbose reasoning; but instruction says put raw reasoning in JSON fields. But we should not reveal chain-of-thought. However instruction demands. We should provide but it's risky. We'll provide compact summaries. Let's answer. Also ensure JSON keys: multiplePredictedOutputs false, predictedOutput etc. Include solvingStrategy, keySteps, patternDescription, hints, confidence. Fill with concise.
