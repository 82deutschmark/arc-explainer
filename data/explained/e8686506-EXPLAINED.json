        "The training examples imply a compact, reduced representation of the input into a smaller grid (5x5 or similar) that encodes color information of localized regions.",
        "One plausible consistent approach is to partition the input into a 5x5 grid of blocks and summarize each block by its dominant color, which yields a small color map reflecting local structure.",
        "For the test input (15x15), a natural non-overlapping partition is five 3x3 blocks per row/column, producing a 5x5 output. In this particular case, all 3x3 blocks appear to be dominated by color 4, leading to a 5x5 grid filled with 4.",
        "This aligns with the hypothesis that the output encodes local color dominance within fixed-size blocks rather than global counts or overlapping windows.",
        "I considered a sliding-window approach (Algorithm B) and a full-grid color tally (Algorithm C), but both either misalign with the plausible training pattern or discard spatial locality, making them less consistent with the examples."
