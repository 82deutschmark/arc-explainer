  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation pattern involves extracting sequences of non-zero values in a specific order, typically focusing on the first occurrence of each unique non-zero value and its immediate context. The output seems to be a condensed representation of these sequences.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Identified that the output grids are smaller subsets of the input grids.",
    "Noticed that the output focuses on sequences of non-zero values, often starting with a pair or triplet of the same number.",
    "Observed that the output sometimes includes a single zero between non-zero numbers, possibly representing a gap or transition.",
    "Confirmed that the pattern holds across all training examples by matching input non-zero sequences to output sequences."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation involves scanning the input grid for sequences of non-zero numbers and representing them in a condensed form in the output. The output typically starts with a pair or triplet of the same number, followed by a zero if there's a gap, and then another pair or triplet. This pattern repeats for each distinct non-zero sequence in the input.",
  "hints": [
    "Best algorithm: Scan the input row by row, collect sequences of non-zero numbers, and for each sequence, output a pair/triplet of the number followed by a zero if there's a gap, then another pair/triplet.",
    "Math algorithm: For each non-zero number n in input, if next number is also n, output [n, n]; if next is zero, output [n, 0]; if next is different, output [n, next].",
