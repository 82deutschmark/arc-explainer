      "patternDescription": "The aliens are copying the original small pattern into a larger square grid multiple times, arranging these copies so they fit together in a mirrored and symmetrical way. They expand the pattern by placing copies side-by-side and above/below each other, filling the entire big box with repeated blocks that look similar and are arranged thoughtfully.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the emojis as numbers: ‚¨õ=0, üëΩ=2, üë§=3, and ü™ê=4. Look at the small pattern (the input) and notice the positions and colors of the symbols. The aliens then create a larger grid by copying this pattern several times to fill the entire big box. They align the copies so the same parts are next to each other, making the pattern symmetrical and organized. To understand this, imagine cutting out the small pattern and placing copies next to each other in a grid, then filling in with mirrored or repeating copies as needed. Basically, to solve it, you can think: 'Repeat the small pattern to make a big square, matching edges and orientations.'",
      "hints": [
        "The larger, final grid is built by repeating the small pattern multiple times.",
        "The copies are arranged to create symmetry, plus sometimes flipped or shifted.",
        "Thinking in terms of copying and pasting small pieces into a big picture helps understand the pattern."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens are likely trying to communicate that they understand how to replicate and duplicate patterns‚Äîto show they can make big, orderly designs from small pieces. It might be a way of saying 'We understand your shapes and can create complex, bigger designs from simple parts,' possibly to show friendliness or cooperation.",

      "patternDescription": "The input grid is being turned into a larger, symmetric, and 'mirror-extended' version of itself. The original grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically, then stacked, making a kind of 'tile' that's reflected to fill a bigger rectangle. Each row becomes two rows, and the grid becomes twice as big in both directions, mirroring and extending the initial structure.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. First, switch to thinking with numbers, since it's easier to see the pattern before converting to emojis. 2. Take your original grid. 3. Mirror each row horizontally (reverse it) and place this mirror to the right side of that row, making each row twice as wide. 4. Now, do the same for the whole grid: mirror the FULL grid vertically (copy all rows, but in reverse order) and stack this on top or bottom, making the grid twice as tall. 5. Convert each number to its emoji using the symbol chart.",
      "hints": [
        "Key insight 1: Each row is mirrored horizontally to create a wider grid.",
        "Key insight 2: The whole grid is mirrored vertically, making it taller and creating symmetry.",
        "Key insight 3: The final result is always an even larger grid, with symmetry both left-right and up-down."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to communicate the concept of 'unity through reflection'‚Äîhow something simple can become harmonious and balanced through symmetry. Since the key symbol in this test case is ü™ê (their planet/home), it may mean they are offering a vision of their home as central and mirrored, wishing us to see their world as reflected in ours.",

      "patternDescription": "They take the original grid as one quadrant ‚Äì specifically the top‚Äêleft quadrant ‚Äì and mirror it both horizontally and vertically. In other words, each input row is written out and then its reverse is tacked on, and then the whole block is flipped top to bottom so that the final picture is symmetric on both axes.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the input grid as a small block (the top-left quadrant). 2. For each row, write the row, then write its mirror image (i.e. the row reversed) to get a full, horizontally symmetrical row. 3. Do this for all rows; that gives you the top half of the final image. 4. Then, create the bottom half by taking these rows in reverse order (a vertical mirror). 5. If you‚Äôre thinking in terms of numbers, follow these same steps and then replace each digit with its corresponding emoji.",
      "hints": [
        "The output has twice the number of rows and twice the number of columns as the input.",
        "Each row of the output is a combination of the original row and its reversed version.",
        "After expanding horizontally, the entire block is mirrored vertically."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens may be using this mirrored design as a symbolic map. With numbers mapping to emojis like ü™ê for their home, the design might be a declaration of symmetry, balance, or unity‚Äîperhaps a way of saying that their world (and perspective) is interconnected with ours. It might be a call for peaceful contact (‚ô•) or just an artistic representation of their planet‚Äôs image in their communication.",

      "solvingStrategy": "1. Think of each emoji as its number (0‚Äì9).  2. For each input row, write it down, then immediately write its reversed version to the right.  This makes the top half.  3. Once you‚Äôve built all rows that way, take those rows in order and then repeat them in reverse order below to mirror vertically.  4. Switch back from numbers to emojis to see the final image.",
      "hints": [
