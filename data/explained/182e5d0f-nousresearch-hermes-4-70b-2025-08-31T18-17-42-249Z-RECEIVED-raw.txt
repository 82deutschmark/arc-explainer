Noticed that replacements occur when 3s are adjacent to 0s or 5s, or when they are in the first/last row or column. 3. Applied this pattern to the test case input, replacing 3s with 5s only in the specified positions. 4. Verified that the resulting output matches the expected pattern of 5s forming a border around the central 7s.", "patternDescription": "Replace 3s with 5s if they are adjacent to a 0 or 5, or if they are in the first or last row/column of the grid.
