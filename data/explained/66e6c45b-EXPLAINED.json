      "reasoningLog": "We are given three examples: two training examples and one test case.\n Each example has an input grid and an output grid.\n\n Training Example 1:\n   Input: [[0,0,0,0],[0,5,6,0],[0,8,3,0],[0,0,0,0]]\n   Output: [[5,0,0,6],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[8,0,0,3]]\n\n Training Example 2:\n   Input: [[0,0,0,0],[0,3,4,0],[0,7,6,0],[0,0,0,0]]\n   Output: [[3,0,0,4],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[7,0,0,6]]\n\n Test Case:\n   Input: [[0,0,0,0],[0,2,3,0],[0,4,9,0],[0,0,0,0]]\n   Correct Output: [[2,0,0,3],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[4,0,0,9]]\n\n Observing the pattern:\n\n In each input grid, we have a 4x4 grid with zeros on the borders and a 2x2 block of non-zero numbers in the center (rows 1-2, columns 1-2, if we index from 0).\n\n The output grid is also 4x4. In the output:\n   - The top row has two non-zero numbers: the first non-zero from the center row1 (which is the top of the center 2x2) and the last non-zero from the center row1.\n   - The bottom row has two non-zero numbers: the first non-zero from the center row2 and the last non-zero from the center row2.\n   - The middle two rows are all zeros.\n\n Specifically, for Example 1:\n   Input center: row1: [5,6] and row2: [8,3]\n   Output: \n        row0: [5,0,0,6] -> which is the first element of row1 (5) and the last element of row1 (6) with zeros in between?\n        Actually, it's [5,0,0,6] -> so it's placed at the corners of the top row.\n        Similarly, row3: [8,0,0,3] -> the first element of row2 (8) and the last element of row2 (3) at the corners of the bottom row.\n\n But note: in the center of the input, row1 is [5,6] and row2 is [8,3]. In the output, the top row has 5 and 6 at the ends, and the bottom row has 8 and 3 at the ends.\n\n However, looking at the positions:\n   Input center: \n        row1: col1=5, col2=6\n        row2: col1=8, col2=3\n\n   Output:\n        row0: col0=5, col3=6\n        row3: col0=8, col3=3\n\n So the transformation is: \n   Take the top center row (row1) and put its first element at (0,0) and last element at (0,3).\n   Take the bottom center row (row2) and put its first element at (3,0) and last element at (3,3).\n\n And the rest of the grid is zeros.\n\n This pattern holds for Example 2:\n   Input: \n        row1: [3,4] -> so in output row0: [3,0,0,4] -> 3 at (0,0) and 4 at (0,3)\n        row2: [7,6] -> output row3: [7,0,0,6] -> 7 at (3,0) and 6 at (3,3)\n\n Now for the test case:\n   Input:\n        row1: [2,3] -> so output row0 should have 2 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,3) -> [2,0,0,3]\n        row2: [4,9] -> output row3 should have 4 at (3,0) and 9 at (3,3) -> [4,0,0,9]\n\n This matches the correct answer.\n\n Therefore, the transformation is: \n   - The output grid has the same dimensions (4x4).\n   - The first row of the output: \n        first element = first element of the center top row (input row1, first element)\n        last element = last element of the center top row (input row1, last element)\n        the middle two columns are 0.\n   - The last row of the output:\n        first element = first element of the center bottom row (input row2, first element)\n        last element = last element of the center bottom row (input row2, last element)\n        the middle two columns are 0.\n   - The middle two rows (row1 and row2 of output) are all zeros.\n\n In terms of ARC-AGI transformations, this could be seen as:\n   - We are extracting the corner elements of the inner 2x2 and placing them at the outer corners of the grid.\n   - Alternatively, it might be seen as a pattern of \"spreading\" the inner row elements to the outer boundaries.\n\n However, note that we are only taking the first and last of each inner row and putting them at the corners of the outer rows.\n\n We can categorize this under:\n   - Pattern Operations: pattern completion? Not exactly.\n   - Grid Operations: grid transformation that moves specific elements to new positions.\n\n Specifically, it might be a kind of \"Grid Splitting\" or \"Translation\" of elements.\n\n But note: the zeros in the output are fixed. So we are creating a new pattern.\n\n Now, for the emoji mapping:\n\n We are to explain in simple terms and also consider the emojis.\n\n The user sees:\n   0: ⬛ (nothing)\n   1: ✅ (yes)\n   2: 👽 (alien)\n   3: 👤 (human)\n   4: 🪐 (their planet)\n   5: 🌍 (Earth)\n   6: 🛸 (their ships)\n   7: ☄️ (danger)\n   8: ♥ (peace)\n   9: ⚠️ (warning)\n\n Let's interpret the test case with emojis:\n\n Input:\n   [[⬛,⬛,⬛,⬛],\n    [⬛,👽,👤,⬛],\n    [⬛,🪐,⚠️,⬛],\n    [⬛,⬛,⬛,⬛]]\n\n Output (correct):\n   [[👽,⬛,⬛,👤],\n    [⬛,⬛,⬛,⬛],\n    [⬛,⬛,⬛,⬛],\n    [🪐,⬛,⬛,⚠️]]\n\n Without the numbers, we can see that the inner 2x2 (which has the non-zeros) is being transformed by taking the top row (👽 and 👤) and putting them at the top corners of the entire grid, and the bottom row (🪐 and ⚠️) and putting them at the bottom corners.\n\n Now, what might the aliens be communicating?\n\n In the input, we have:\n   Top center row: alien and human together.\n   Bottom center row: their planet and a warning.\n\n In the output, the alien and human are separated at the top corners, and their planet and warning are at the bottom corners.\n\n The separation might indicate that the aliens are trying to show that they and humans are on opposite sides (top row, but at the ends) and similarly their planet and a warning are at opposite ends at the bottom.\n\n The fact that the middle is empty might signify that there is a gap or separation.\n\n Speculating about the message:\n\n   The aliens (👽) and humans (👤) are being placed at the top corners. This might represent that they are on opposite sides of an issue or geographically separated.\n\n   Their planet (🪐) and a warning (⚠️) are at the bottom corners. This might indicate that there is a warning about their planet (or from their planet) that is also being separated.\n\n   The empty middle might mean that there is no connection or that the situation is empty of solutions.\n\n   Considering the transformation: the inner togetherness is being spread apart to the outer edges. This might symbolize expansion or separation.\n\n   Given that in the training examples we had:\n\n   Example 1:\n      Input: [5,6] and [8,3] -> Earth and their ships, then peace and human.\n      Output: Earth at top-left, their ships at top-right; peace at bottom-left, human at bottom-right.\n\n      So Earth and their ships are separated (maybe they are leaving Earth? or Earth and their ships are apart) and peace and human are separated.\n\n   Example 2:\n      Input: [3,4] and [7,6] -> human and their planet, then danger and their ships.\n      Output: human at top-left, their planet at top-right; danger at bottom-left, their ships at bottom-right.\n\n      So human and their planet are separated? (maybe they are not on the same page) and danger and their ships are separated (maybe the danger is not directly on the ships?).\n\n   In the test case: \n        Input: alien and human together, their planet and warning together.\n        Output: alien at top-left, human at top-right; their planet at bottom-left, warning at bottom-right.\n\n   This might be showing that the alien and human are being separated (maybe conflict?) and the warning about their planet is being separated (so the warning is not directly on the planet?).\n\n   But note: the aliens are using this as a communication. They might be trying to convey a message about separation or distance.\n\n   Alternatively, it might be a representation of a journey: the top row is the start (alien and human) and the bottom row is the destination (their planet and a warning). But they are at the corners, so maybe they are moving apart.\n\n   Given the symbols, the warning at the bottom right might be a sign of danger at the end.\n\n   Considering the transformation type: we are moving the inner elements to the outer corners. This could be seen as \"expanding the influence\" or \"spreading out\".\n\n   But the empty middle might also mean that the center is void, which could be interpreted as a lack of communication or understanding.\n\n   Since the aliens are communicating with us, and they are including humans and themselves, it might be about the relationship.\n\n   The fact that in the output the alien is on the left and the human on the right at the top, and their planet on the left and warning on the right at the bottom, might indicate:\n\n      Top: Alien (them) and Human (us) are at opposite ends -> conflict or separation.\n      Bottom: Their planet and a warning -> so their home has a warning? Or a warning about their home?\n\n   We might speculate that the aliens are warning us about something related to their planet? But note the warning is separated from the planet.\n\n   Alternatively, the entire grid might represent a timeline: top is past, bottom is future. So in the past, alien and human were together (input) but now they are separated (output). In the future, their planet and a warning are separated? But that doesn't make complete sense.\n\n   Another idea: the aliens might be trying to show that they are moving away (from the center to the corners) and that there is a warning for us.\n\n   Given the symbols, the warning (⚠️) is at the bottom right. In many cultures, the right side is the future or positive? But here it's a warning.\n\n   We have to make a creative guess. Let's say:\n\n   \"The aliens are showing that they and humans are becoming separated (alien on one side, human on the other) and that their planet is facing a warning. They might be trying to tell us that there is a problem with their home world and that it is causing a rift between our species.\"\n\n   But note: in the test case, the input had the alien and human together and the planet and warning together. The output separates them. So the transformation is causing the separation. The aliens might be using this to symbolize that they are forced apart by circumstances (the warning about their planet).\n\n   Confidence in the transformation: very high (100%) because the pattern is clear and consistent.\n\n   Confidence in the alien meaning: speculative. We are not sure. Maybe 60%.\n\n Steps for the user:\n\n   The puzzle is about moving the non-zero numbers from the center to the corners of the grid.\n\n   Step-by-step:\n\n     1. Look at the input grid. Notice that the center 2x2 (the middle two rows and middle two columns) has the non-zero numbers. The rest are zeros.\n\n     2. Focus on the top row of the center (which is the second row of the grid, since we start at 0). It has two numbers: the first one (on the left) and the last one (on the right).\n\n     3. In the output grid, the very top row (first row) will have:\n          - the first number from step 2 at the very left (first column)\n          - the last number from step 2 at the very right (last column)\n          - and zeros in the middle.\n\n     4. Now look at the bottom row of the center (the third row of the grid). It also has two numbers: first and last.\n\n     5. In the output grid, the very bottom row (last row) will have:\n          - the first number from step 4 at the very left (first column)\n          - the last number from step 4 at the very right (last column)\n          - and zeros in the middle.\n\n     6. The middle two rows of the output (second and third) are all zeros.\n\n   So in the test case:\n\n        Input center top row: [2,3] -> so output top row: [2,0,0,3]\n        Input center bottom row: [4,9] -> so output bottom row: [4,0,0,9]\n\n   And the rest are zeros.\n\n   Hints:\n\n     1. The non-zero numbers are only in the center 2x2 of the input.\n     2. The output has non-zero numbers only at the four corners of the entire grid? Actually, only at the corners of the top and bottom rows, not the sides of the middle rows. Specifically, the top row has non-zero at the first and last column, and the bottom row has non-zero at the first and last column. The middle rows are all zero.\n     3. The positions: the top center row's left number goes to the top left of the grid, and its right number goes to the top right. Similarly for the bottom center row.\n\n   Since the user sees emojis, we can explain without numbers, but the transformation is the same.\n\n   Pattern Description: \n        \"The puzzle takes the inner square of symbols and spreads the top row's symbols to the outer top corners and the bottom row's symbols to the outer bottom corners, leaving the middle empty.\"\n\n   Solving Strategy:\n        \"Look at the inner square (the non-black part). The top row of that inner square: the first symbol goes to the top-left corner of the whole grid, and the last symbol goes to the top-right corner. The bottom row of the inner square: the first symbol goes to the bottom-left corner, and the last symbol goes to the bottom-right corner. Then, fill the rest with black (zeros).\"\n\n   Hints (key insights):\n        Hint 1: \"The input has a black border and a small square of symbols in the center.\"\n        Hint 2: \"In the output, the symbols from the center's top row move to the top edge of the grid, one at each end.\"\n        Hint 3: \"The symbols from the center's bottom row move to the bottom edge, one at each end, and the middle of the grid becomes all black.\"\n\n   Alien Meaning:\n        \"The aliens might be showing that they and humans are being separated (alien on the left, human on the right at the top) and that their home planet and a warning are also being separated (planet on the left, warning on the right at the bottom). This could mean that there is a problem with their planet that is causing a divide between our species. They might be warning us about an impending danger that affects both of us, leading to separation.\"\n\n   Confidence in the transformation: 100%\n   Confidence in the alien meaning: 60% (because it's speculative)\n\n Now, we must output in JSON only.",
