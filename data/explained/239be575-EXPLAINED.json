The correct answer is '8' because the pattern highlights or emphasizes this symbol, similar to how in previous examples the most frequent or central symbol was chosen.",

To solve these puzzles, look for which symbol seems to dominate or is most consistent across the grid. In this case, the pattern points to '8', so the aliens are emphasizing friendship or good relations. Just like translating numbers to emojis, focus on the most noticeable or recurring symbol to find the answer.",

Pay attention to the relationships between the emojis (numbers) and how they are grouped or clustered.

However, the presence of the ☄️ (danger/bad/problem) emoji also indicates that they may be warning us about potential threats or challenges that we need to be aware of.",

      "patternDescription": "The puzzle is nothing more than an even-vs-odd check of how many empty (⬛) squares there are.  If that number is EVEN, the aliens want us to reply with a ♥.  If it is ODD, we must reply with another ⬛.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. (Optional) Change the emojis back to numbers so they’re easier to add up – ⬛ = 0, ♥ = 8, 👽 = 2.\n2. Go through the whole grid and count every ⬛ (0).  You don’t have to look at the other colours at all.\n3. Is the count even?  • Yes → output a single cell containing ♥ (8).  • No → output a single cell containing ⬛ (0).\n4. For the test grid there are 20 ⬛ squares, 20 is even, so we output ♥ – which matches the given correct answer [[8]].",

        "Ignore the alien (👽) and heart (♥) pieces at first – just count the black squares (⬛).",
        "Ask yourself: is the tally even or odd?",
        "Even → ♥,  Odd → ⬛."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "It looks like the aliens are sending a very simple parity signal: a single ♥ means “even”, a single ⬛ means “odd”.  In other words, they’re testing whether we understand the idea of evenness – a basic building-block of mathematics.  That seems more friendly than hostile: they’re teaching, not threatening.",
