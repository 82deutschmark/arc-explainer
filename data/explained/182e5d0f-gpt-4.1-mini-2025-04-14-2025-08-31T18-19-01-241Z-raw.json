  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves identifying the vertical columns of 3s in the input grid and replacing the first 3 in each such column with a 5, while turning all other 3s in that column into 7s. The rest of the grid remains unchanged. This is consistent across all training examples. The 5 replaces the topmost 3 in each vertical cluster, and the other 3s below it are replaced by 7s, effectively highlighting the 'big butt' (the 5) and removing other 3s in that column. The 0s and other numbers remain unchanged. Applying this rule to the test input produces the predicted output.",
