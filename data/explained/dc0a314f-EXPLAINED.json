      "reasoningLog": "Let me analyze this puzzle step by step by looking at the patterns in the training examples and the test case.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the structure of each input grid. They all appear to be 16x16 grids with some kind of central rectangular region that's different from the border.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- The input is 16x16\n- There's a central rectangular region that seems to contain different numbers (8, 7, 3)\n- The output is 5x5\n- The border seems to be made up of numbers like 1, 2, 5, 6\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Also 16x16 input\n- Central region with 3's, and some other distinct numbers\n- Output is 5x5\n- Border contains numbers like 8, 9, 7, 2, 1\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n- 16x16 input\n- Central region with 3's again\n- Output is 5x5\n- Border contains numbers like 2, 4, 5, 9\n\nNow for the test case:\n- 16x16 input\n- Central region with 3's (rows 4-8, columns 8-12 approximately)\n- Expected output is 5x5\n\nLet me look more carefully at the structure. It seems like there are several distinct regions:\n1. An outer border\n2. An inner region \n3. A central rectangular region filled with 3's\n\nLooking at the test case more carefully:\n- There's a central 5x5 block of 3's (human symbols)\n- Around this, there appears to be a region with numbers like 4, 6, 9\n- The rest is filled with 2, 5, 8\n\nLet me examine what happens in the transformation:\nIn Example 1, the central 5x5 region of 3's gets replaced, and the output seems to come from the region immediately surrounding the 3's.\n\nLooking at the test case input around the 3's:\nRow 4: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,2]\nRow 5: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,5,5]\nRow 6: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5]\nRow 7: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\nRow 8: [5,2,5,5,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,2,5]\nRow 9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5]\nRow 10: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,9,9,6,6,2,2,5,5]\nRow 11: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,9,6,6,4,5,5,5,2]\n\nThe 3's occupy columns 8-12 in rows 4-8. The region to the left of the 3's (columns 4-7) seems to be what becomes the output.\n\nFrom row 4: columns 4-7 are [4,6,6,9] - but the output first row is [9,6,6,4,5]\nFrom row 5: columns 4-7 are [6,6,9,9] - output second row is [9,9,6,6,2]\n\nWait, let me look at this differently. Maybe the transformation takes the region that was to the left of the 3's and mirrors or transforms it somehow, then adds the rightmost column from somewhere else.\n\nActually, let me check if the output comes from taking the left side of the inner region and then the right side, or some combination.\n\nLooking at the correct answer: [[9,6,6,4,5],[9,9,6,6,2],[9,6,9,6,5],[9,9,9,9,5],[9,9,9,9,5]]\n\nComparing with the input region around the 3's:\n- The first column of output is [9,9,9,9,9] \n- Looking at column 7 (just left of 3's): [9,9,9,9,9] in rows 4-8 - this matches!\n- The second column of output is [6,9,6,9,9]\n- Looking at column 6: [6,6,9,9,9] in rows 4-8 - close but not exact\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe it's taking the region to the left of the 3's and the region to the right of the 3's and combining them somehow.\n\nLeft region (columns 4-7, rows 4-8):\n[4,6,6,9]\n[6,6,9,9]  \n[6,9,6,9]\n[9,9,9,9]\n[9,9,9,9]\n\nRight region (columns 13-16 would be outside, so maybe columns 9-12 after the 3's are removed):\nLooking at rows 9-11 where the 3's have been replaced:\nRow 9: [5,2,2,5,6,9,6,9,9,6,9,6,5,2,2,5] - columns 9-12 are [9,6,9,6]\nRow 10: [5,5,2,2,6,6,9,9,9,9,6,6,2,2,5,5] - columns 9-12 are [9,9,6,6]  \nRow 11: [2,5,5,5,4,6,6,9,9,6,6,4,5,5,5,2] - columns 9-12 are [9,6,6,4]\n\nI think the pattern is: take the 5x5 region immediately to the left of the central 3's block, then flip it horizontally, and add a column from the right side.\n\nActually, let me try: take the left region and flip it, then take the rightmost column from the corresponding right region.\n\nLeft region flipped horizontally:\n[9,6,6,4]\n[9,9,6,6]\n[9,6,9,6] \n[9,9,9,9]\n[9,9,9,9]\n\nThen add the rightmost available column. Looking at the pattern, it seems like the 5th column comes from the rightmost part of the original border or structure.\n\nThe 5th column in the answer is [5,2,5,5,5]. Looking at the test input, column 13 in rows 4-8 is [5,2,2,5,5]. Close!\n\nI think the transformation is: extract the 5x4 region immediately to the left of the central 3x3 block, flip it horizontally, then add a 5th column from the corresponding position on the right side of the structure.",
