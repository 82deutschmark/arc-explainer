The second row is for the top-right quadrant, and the third row is for the bottom-right quadrant. The quadrants are defined as follows:\n\nQuadrant 1 (top-left): Top-left corner of the input grid.\nQuadrant 2 (top-right): Top-right corner of the input grid.\nQuadrant 3 (bottom-right): Bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n\nSpecifically:\n- output[0][0] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the top-left quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[0][1] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the top-middle quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[0][2] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the top-right quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[1][0] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the middle-left quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[1][1] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the middle-middle quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[1][2] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the middle-right quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[2][0] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the bottom-left quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[2][1] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the bottom-middle quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n- output[2][2] = 1 if both 2 and 3 are present in the bottom-right quadrant, 0 otherwise.\n\nHowever, after further analysis, the quadrants are defined as follows:\n- Top-left: Contains the number 2 and 3\n- Top-right: Contains the number 2 and 3\n- Bottom-right: Contains the number 2 and 3\n\nFor Test 1:\n- Top-left: Contains 2 and 3, so output[0][0] = 1\n- Top-right: Does not contain 2 and 3, so output[0][2] = 0\n- Bottom-right: Contains 2 and 3, so output[2][2] = 1\n\nFor Test 2:\n- Top-left: Contains 2 and 3, so output[0][0] = 1\n- Top-right: Contains 2 and 3, so output[0][2] = 1\n- Bottom-right: Contains 2 and 3, so output[2][2] = 0\n\n",
