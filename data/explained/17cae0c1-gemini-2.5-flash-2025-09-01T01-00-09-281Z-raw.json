This means the transformation is likely independent of the row index, or aggregates information across rows.\",\n  \"2. Observe the output content: The output grids are composed of three 3x3 blocks, each filled with a single color. For example, in Example 1, the output is [[3,3,3,4,4,4,9,9,9], [3,3,3,4,4,4,9,9,9], [3,3,3,4,4,4,9,9,9]]. This suggests that the input grid is being processed in 3x3 columns.\",\n  \"3. Analyze the input content: The input grids contain '5's and '0's. The '5's seem to represent 'active' cells.\",\n  \"4. Relate input '5's to output colors: For each 3x3 column block in the input, count the number of '5's. Let's call this count 'N'.

This is a contradiction. Re-evaluate.\",\n  \"7. Re-evaluation: The count of '5's is not the only factor, or the mapping is not direct. Let's re-examine the output colors and the input '5's. The output colors are 1, 3, 4, 6, 9. These are not directly related to the count of '5's in a simple arithmetic way.\",\n  \"8. Alternative hypothesis: What if the output color is related to the *number of '0's* in the 3x3 block? Or the *number of '5's in each row* of the 3x3 block? Or the *sum of '5's in each row* of the 3x3 block?\",\n  \"9. Let's reconsider the count of '5's. The output colors are 1, 3, 4, 6, 9. These are specific colors. Is there a pattern in the *number of '5's* that maps to these specific colors?\",\n  \"   - Example 1: Counts (8, 1, 3) -> Colors (3, 4, 9)\",\n  \"   - Example 2: Counts (3, 3, 1) -> Colors (9, 1, 4)\",\n  \"   - Example 3: Counts (7, 3, 7) -> Colors (6, 3, 1)\",\n  \"   - Example 4: Counts (3, 2, 7) -> Colors (4, 6, 3)\",\n  \"10. This is still not a direct mapping. Let's look at the *total count of '5's in the entire input grid* and how it relates to the output. No, the output is segmented into 3 blocks.\",\n  \"11. Let's focus on the output colors again: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9. These are not arbitrary. They are specific. What if the output color is simply the *number of '5's in the first row of each 3x3 block*? No, that doesn't make sense because the output rows are identical.\",\n  \"12. What if the output color is the *number of '5's in the middle row of each 3x3 block*? No.\",\n  \"13.

Let's list all observed mappings:\",\n  \"   - Count 8 -> Color 3 (Ex1, block 1)\",\n  \"   - Count 1 -> Color 4 (Ex1, block 2)\",\n  \"   - Count 3 -> Color 9 (Ex1, block 3)\",\n  \"   - Count 3 -> Color 9 (Ex2, block 1) - Consistent!\",\n  \"   - Count 3 -> Color 1 (Ex2, block 2) - Inconsistent! This is the problem.\",\n  \"   - Count 1 -> Color 4 (Ex2, block 3) - Consistent!\",\n  \"   - Count 7 -> Color 6 (Ex3, block 1)\",\n  \"   - Count 3 -> Color 3 (Ex3, block 2) - Inconsistent again!

The simple count of '5's in a 3x3 block is NOT the direct mapping. The output colors are always 1, 3, 4, 6, 9. This suggests a fixed set of possible output colors.\",\n  \"17. What if the output color is determined by the *position* of the 3x3 block, and the *number of '5's* in it? No, the colors change for the same position.\",\n  \"18. Let's look at the *number of '5's in each row* within a 3x3 block. For example, block 1 of Ex1: [[5,5,5],[5,0,5],[5,5,5]]. Row counts: (3, 2, 3). Output color: 3.\",\n  \"   - Block 2 of Ex1: [[0,0,0],[0,5,0],[0,0,0]]. Row counts: (0, 1, 0). Output color: 4.\",\n  \"   - Block 3 of Ex1: [[0,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,0]]. Row counts: (1, 1, 1). Output color: 9.\",\n  \"19. Let's try to find a pattern in (row1_count, row2_count, row3_count) -> output_color.\",\n  \"   - (3,2,3) -> 3\",\n  \"   - (0,1,0) -> 4\",\n  \"   - (1,1,1) -> 9\",\n  \"   - (1,1,1) -> 9 (Ex2, block 1) - Consistent!

The output is always 3x9, with all rows identical, and composed of three 3x3 blocks of solid color. This means the transformation is applied to each 3-column segment of the input, and the result is a single color for that segment, which then fills the corresponding 3x3 output block.\",\n  \"21. The key must be a unique property of the 3x3 input block that maps to a unique output color. The total count of '5's is not unique. The row counts are not unique.\",\n  \"22. Let's look at the *shape* formed by the '5's. This is a common ARC pattern.\",\n  \"   - Ex1, block 1: [[5,5,5],[5,0,5],[5,5,5]] - Almost a full 3x3 square. Missing center.
