It seems that the idea is to change every 0 to a border number of 5, except when that 0 is next to a non-zero number. The examples show that the rightmost cell in a row can change to 5, while other rows exhibit variations. For instance, in row inputs with all 0s, they become 5s, but in a mixed input row, the zeros can also adopt values based on adjacent numbers. It's looking like there's a pattern to these changes that needs further exploration!\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Analyzing grid transformation rules**\\n\\nI'm exploring how the transformation works in the grid. For instance, with input like [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0], the first non-zero number influences the output, where the rest become the fill color. I'm starting to see a pattern: distinct colors—like the ball colors and a fill color—are present. \\n\\nIt seems that the transformation involves identifying regions of non-zero numbers, where some output cells reflect the original object's color based on their position relative to the object. The output always ends with a fill border, which suggests a consistent rule for this transformation.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Examining object positioning in grid**\\n\\nI'm analyzing how objects shift within the grid based on their bounding boxes. For example, it appears that non-zero objects can shift left and upward if there's space. Looking at clusters like color 7, even separated by zeros, the transformation shows that each cluster is likely shifted to the left, preserving their order while filling the right with a default value. \\n\\nIf a row has all zeros, the result is entirely filled. It seems there’s a consistent pattern emerging with this shift mechanism, where the blocks identify their new positions while ensuring that existing zeros are replaced with the fill color.\"}]",
