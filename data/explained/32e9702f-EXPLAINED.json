This is done by setting the cell immediately to the left of the block to the non-zero value and setting the cell at the right end of the block to 5. If the block is already at the left boundary of the grid, only the right end is set to 5, reducing the block size. All other cells in the grid are set to 5, which serves as a background value.",
      "solvingStrategy": "Step 1: Identify all rows in the input grid that contain contiguous blocks of non-zero cells (value 6 in this case). Step 2: For each such row, apply the left-shift operation: set the cell to the left of the block to 6 (if it exists and is within bounds), and set the cell at the right end of the block to 5. Step 3: For rows without non-zero blocks, set all cells to 5. Step 4: Construct the output grid based on these changes.

      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern. The input is a grid with zeros and some numbers (like 3, 4, 7 in the examples), and the output has those numbers replaced or modified, with many cells turning into 5 or another number.\n\nLet's look at each training example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]]\n\nNotice that in the output, most cells are 5, but the cells that had 3 in the input remain 3, except some are changed. Specifically, the blocks of 3 seem to be preserved, but the surrounding zeros are filled with 5. Also, in the output, the 3's are only where they were originally, but the pattern might be that the non-zero numbers are kept, and zeros are replaced with 5, but not all zeros; it seems like the zeros adjacent to the non-zero blocks might be turning into 5 or something.\n\nLet's check the positions. In input, there's a horizontal block of 3's in row 1, columns 2 to 5, and a smaller block in row 4, columns 1 to 2. In output, those 3's are still there, but now many cells are 5. It looks like the entire grid is filled with 5, except the cells that originally had non-zero values, which are kept, and perhaps some cells around them.\n\nBut in the output, the non-zero cells are exactly where they were in input, no new non-zero cells are added; the values are preserved for non-zero cells, and zeros are set to 5. But wait, in the input, there are zeros that are not changed to 5? No, in output, all cells that were zero in input are now 5, except that the non-zero cells remain.\n\nConfirm: In input, all cells are 0 except some 3's. In output, all cells are 5 except the cells that had 3, which are still 3. But look at row 1, column 1: input has 0, output has 5. Row 1, column 6: input has 0 (since 3's are up to column 5), output has 5. Row 2, column 1: input 0, output 5. Row 4, column 1: input has 3, output has 3. Row 4, column 3: input has 0 (since 3's are only columns 1-2), output has 5. So yes, it seems that in the output, all cells that were zero in input are set to 5, and all non-zero cells keep their value.\n\nBut in example 2 and 3, let's see if that holds.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput: [[4,4,4],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[4,4,5],[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]\n\nHere, the top row has 4's, and they are kept. The zeros are set to 5, but notice that the last element of the first row was 4 in input? Input: row 0: [4,4,4] so all 4's. Output: row 0: [4,4,5] – wait, the last one is 5, not 4. Input has three 4's, output has two 4's and one 5. That doesn't match my initial thought.\n\nIn input, first row is all 4's, but in output, the last element is 5. So not all non-zero cells are kept; some are changed.\n\nPerhaps it's about the blocks. Maybe the non-zero cells that are part of a contiguous block are kept, but isolated or something.\n\nIn example 2, the input has a row of three 4's, which might be a horizontal block. But in output, the last 4 is changed to 5. Why?\n\nLook at the grid size: 3x3. Perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero blocks are filled, but the edges or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is setting all cells to 5, but the cells that are \"connected\" to the non-zero blocks in a certain way are kept as is.\n\nIn example 2, the input has a horizontal line of 4's at the top. In output, the first two 4's are kept, but the last one is 5. Maybe it's based on adjacency or connectivity.\n\nPerhaps it's about the number of adjacent non-zero cells or something.\n\nLet's list the cells:\n\nIn example 2 input:\n\nCell (0,0): 4\n\n(0,1): 4\n\n(0,2): 4\n\nAll others 0.\n\nOutput: (0,0):4, (0,1):4, (0,2):5, and all others 5.\n\nWhy is (0,2) changed to 5? Maybe because it's at the edge or not sufficiently connected.\n\nLook at example 1.\n\nIn example 1 input, there are two blocks of 3's: one horizontal from (1,2) to (1,5), and another at (4,1) and (4,2).\n\nIn output, all these 3's are kept. No 3 is changed to 5.\n\nIn example 1, all non-zero cells are kept, and zeros become 5. But in example 2, not all non-zero cells are kept; (0,2) is changed to 5.\n\nDifference: in example 2, the non-zero block is at the edge of the grid? In example 1, the blocks are not at the very edge; they have zeros around.\n\nIn example 2, the 4's are at the top row, which might be the edge.\n\nBut in example 1, the block at (1,2) to (1,5) is not at the row edge but column edge? Row 1, columns 2 to 5: column 2 is not the first column, column 5 is not the last (since grid is 8x8, columns 0 to 7).\n\nGrid indices: probably 0-based. In example 1, rows and columns from 0 to 7.\n\nBlock from (1,2) to (1,5): so column 2 is index 2, not 0; column 5 is index 5, not 7 (last is 7). So not at column edge.\n\nSimilarly, block at (4,1) and (4,2): column 1 and 2, not edge.\n\nIn example 2, the 4's are at column 0,1,2 of row 0, so column 2 is the last column since grid is 3x3, columns 0,1,2.\n\nAh, so in example 2, the non-zero cell at the corner or edge is changed to 5.\n\nIn output, (0,2) is 5, which is the last column.\n\nBut in example 1, all non-zero cells are kept, and they are not at the absolute edge of the grid? In example 1, the block from (1,2) to (1,5): column 2 is not first column (0), column 5 is not last (7), so not edge.\n\nThe block at (4,1) and (4,2): column 1 and 2, not first or last.\n\nIn example 3, let's see.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nInput: [[7,7,7,7,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,7,7,7,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,7,7,7,7,7,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[7,7,7,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,7,7,7,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[7,7,7,7,7,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,5,5,5]]\n\nGrid is 7x7.\n\nNon-zero cells: row 0: columns 0 to 3 have 7's (since [7,7,7,7,0,0,0] so indices 0,1,2,3 have 7)\n\nRow 2: columns 2,3,4 have 7's ([0,0,7,7,7,0,0] so indices 2,3,4)\n\nRow 4: columns 1 to 5 have 7's ([0,7,7,7,7,7,0] so indices 1,2,3,4,5)\n\nIn output, for row 0: cells with 7 in input are (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3) but in output, (0,0),(0,1),(0,2) are 7, but (0,3) is 5? Input row 0: [7,7,7,7,0,0,0] so (0,3) has 7, but output is [7,7,7,5,5,5,5] so (0,3) is 5, not 7.\n\nSimilarly, in row 2: input has 7 at (2,2),(2,3),(2,4), output has [5,7,7,7,5,5,5] so (2,2),(2,3),(2,4) are 7? Output row 2: [5,7,7,7,5,5,5] so indices: let's assume columns from left: position 0:5, 1:7, 2:7, 3:7, 4:5, etc. So (2,1),(2,2),(2,3) are 7, but input had 7 at (2,2),(2,3),(2,4)? In input, row 2: [0,0,7,7,7,0,0] so if we index from 0, column 0:0, 1:0, 2:7, 3:7, 4:7, 5:0, 6:0. So (2,2),(2,3),(2,4) have 7.\n\nBut in output, row 2: [5,7,7,7,5,5,5] so column 0:5, 1:7, 2:7, 3:7, 4:5, 5:5, 6:5. So (2,1),(2,2),(2,3) are 7, but (2,4) is 5, which had 7 in input.\n\nSimilarly, in row 4: input [0,7,7,7,7,7,0] so (4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5) have 7. Output row 4: [7,7,7,7,7,5,5] so (4,0) is 7? Input (4,0) is 0, output is 7? No, output row 4: [7,7,7,7,7,5,5] so if columns 0 to 6, (4,0) is 7, but input (4,0) is 0. In input, row 4: [0,7,7,7,7,7,0] so column 0:0, 1:7, 2:7, 3:7, 4:7, 5:7, 6:0. Output: [7,7,7,7,7,5,5] so (4,0) is 7, which was 0 in input? That can't be right.\n\nI think I misindexed. Let's list the rows and columns properly.\n\nAssume rows and columns are 0-indexed from the left.\n\nFor example 3 input:\n\nRow 0: [7,7,7,7,0,0,0]  // columns 0 to 6: col0=7, col1=7, col2=7, col3=7, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,7,7,0,0]  // col0=0, col1=0, col2=7, col3=7, col4=7, col5=0, col6=0\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,7,7,7,7,7,0]  // col0=0, col1=7, col2=7, col3=7, col4=7, col5=7, col6=0\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: [7,7,7,5,5,5,5]  // so col0=7, col1=7, col2=7, col3=5, col4=5, col5=5, col6=5\n\nRow 1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 2: [5,7,7,7,5,5,5]  // col0=5, col1=7, col2=7, col3=7, col4=5, col5=5, col6=5\n\nRow 3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 4: [7,7,7,7,7,5,5]  // col0=7, col1=7, col2=7, col3=7, col4=7, col5=5, col6=5\n\nRow 5: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 6: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nNow, compare input and output:\n\n- In row 0, input col0,1,2,3 have 7, output col0,1,2 have 7, col3 has 5. So (0,3) changed from 7 to 5.\n\n- In row 2, input col2,3,4 have 7, output col1,2,3 have 7, col4 has 5. So (2,4) changed from 7 to 5, and (2,1) is 7 but input (2,1) was 0? Input row2 col1 is 0, output is 7? No, output row2 col1 is 7, but input was 0. In input, row2: col0=0, col1=0, col2=7, col3=7, col4=7, etc. Output row2: col0=5, col1=7, col2=7, col3=7, col4=5, etc. So (2,1) is 7 in output but was 0 in input. That means a cell that was 0 is now 7? But in the pattern, we thought zeros become 5, but here a zero became 7? No, (2,1) was 0, output is 7, which is not 5. But 7 is the non-zero number, so perhaps cells are set to the non-zero value if they are adjacent or something.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that the output fills the grid with the non-zero number from the blocks, but only the cells that are part of the block or connected in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's a flood fill or connectivity thing where the non-zero blocks \"expand\" or something.\n\nLook at the changes:\n\nIn row 0 output, (0,3) is 5 instead of 7, but (0,0),(0,1),(0,2) are 7. Perhaps the block is truncated.\n\nNotice that in all outputs, the number 5 is used for cells that are not part of the original non-zero blocks or something.\n\nBut in example 2, output has 5 where some 4's were.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each contiguous block of non-zero cells, we keep the cells that are within a certain distance or something.\n\nLet's think about the values. In all examples, the output has the same non-zero number as input, and 5 for others, but not always.\n\nIn example 1, non-zero is 3, output has 3 and 5.\n\nIn example 2, non-zero is 4, output has 4 and 5.\n\nIn example 3, non-zero is 7, output has 7 and 5.\n\nSo the number 5 is consistent for \"background\" or something.\n\nNow, which cells keep the non-zero value? It seems that cells that are \"internal\" to the block are kept, while cells on the \"edge\" of the block are changed to 5, but also some cells that were zero might be set to the non-zero value if they are adjacent.\n\nIn example 3, row 2 output: (2,1) is 7, but input was 0, so it was set to 7, meaning it became part of the block.\n\nSimilarly, in row 4 output: (4,0) is 7, input was 0, so set to 7.\n\nIn row 0 output: (0,3) is 5, input was 7, so changed to 5.\n\nSo it seems that the non-zero blocks are growing or shrinking.\n\nPerhaps it's about the number of adjacent non-zero cells. Or perhaps it's a cellular automaton or something.\n\nAnother thought: look at the boundaries. In example 1, the blocks are surrounded by zeros, and in output, they are still there.\n\nIn example 2, the block is at the top, and the last cell is changed to 5.\n\nIn example 3, the blocks seem to have changed shape.\n\nLet's list the non-zero cells in input and output for example 3.\n\nInput non-zero: \n- Block 1: row 0, col 0-3 (4 cells)\n- Block 2: row 2, col 2-4 (3 cells)\n- Block 3: row 4, col 1-5 (5 cells)\n\nOutput non-zero:\n- Row 0: col 0-2 are 7, so block might be row 0 col 0-2 (3 cells)\n- Row 2: col 1-3 are 7, so block row 2 col 1-3 (3 cells)\n- Row 4: col 0-4 are 7, so block row 4 col 0-4 (5 cells)\n\nIn output, for row 0, the block shrunk from col 0-3 to col 0-2, so (0,3) changed to 5.\n\nFor row 2, the block moved or changed: input was col 2-4, output is col 1-3, so (2,4) changed to 5, and (2,1) changed from 0 to 7.\n\nFor row 4, the block expanded from col 1-5 to col 0-4, so (4,0) changed from 0 to 7, and (4,5) changed from 7 to 5? Input (4,5) is 7, output (4,5) is 5, so changed to 5.\n\nIn all cases, the number of non-zero cells might be changing, but not consistently.\n\nPerhaps it's about the \"center\" of the block or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that each cell is set to the value of the majority of its neighbors or something, but that might be complicated.\n\nLet's look at the values. Notice that in the output, the non-zero cells are always connected in a way that they form rectangles or something.\n\nIn example 1 output, the 3's are in two small blocks.\n\nIn example 2 output, the 4's are in a smaller block.\n\nIn example 3 output, the 7's are in blocks that are more square or compact.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is to make the non-zero blocks as compact as possible, like reducing their size or centering them.\n\nBut in example 3, for row 4, the block expanded leftward from col 1-5 to col 0-4, so it moved left, and the right end was cut off.\n\nSimilarly, for row 0, the right end was cut off.\n\nFor row 2, the block shifted left: from col 2-4 to col 1-3.\n\nSo perhaps the blocks are being shifted towards the left or something.\n\nIn example 2, the block was at col 0-2, and in output, it's at col 0-1 with (0,2) changed to 5, so shifted left? From col 0-2 to col 0-1, so right end removed.\n\nIn example 1, the block at row 1 col 2-5 is still there, no change? In output, it's the same: row 1 col 2-5 are 3, and row 4 col 1-2 are 3, both unchanged.\n\nIn example 1, the blocks didn't change position or size.\n\nIn example 1 input, block1: row1 col2-5 (4 cells), block2: row4 col1-2 (2 cells)\n\nOutput: same cells have 3, so no change for non-zero cells in example 1.\n\nBut in example 2 and 3, there are changes.\n\nWhy? Perhaps because in example 1, the blocks are not adjacent to the grid boundary in a way that requires change.\n\nIn example 2, the block is at the top row, and it's horizontal, so perhaps it's truncated.\n\nIn example 3, the blocks are near the center or something.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero cells are kept only if they are part of a group that has a certain size or connectivity.\n\nLet's think about the number 5. In all outputs, the background is 5, so perhaps 5 is a default value.\n\nNow for the test case, the input has number 6, so output should have 6 and 5.\n\nInput for test case: [[0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nGrid is 10x10.\n\nNon-zero cells: \n- Row 0: col 2 to 6 have 6? [0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0] so col2,3,4,5,6 have 6 (5 cells)\n- Row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0] so col6,7 have 6? Col indices: 0 to 9, so col6 and col7 have 6 (2 cells)\n- Row 4: [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0] so col1,2,3 have 6 (3 cells)\n- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6] so col4 to 9 have 6 (6 cells)\n\nAnd all other cells are 0.\n\nNow, from the training examples, I need to find a pattern.\n\nLet's list the changes in training examples.\n\nIn example 1: no change to non-zero cells; all zeros become 5.\n\nIn example 2: the non-zero block was reduced in size; the rightmost cell was changed to 5. Specifically, from [4,4,4] to [4,4,5], so the last element of the row was changed to 5.\n\nIn example 3: \n- For row 0, the non-zero block was reduced on the right: from col0-3 to col0-2, so (0,3) changed to 5.\n- For row 2, the non-zero block shifted left: from col2-4 to col1-3, so (2,4) changed to 5, and (2,1) changed from 0 to 7.\n- For row 4, the non-zero block shifted left: from col1-5 to col0-4, so (4,0) changed from 0 to 7, and (4,5) changed from 7 to 5.\n\nIn all cases where there is a change, the non-zero block seems to be moving leftward or being truncated on the right.\n\nIn example 2, the block is already at the left? Col0-2, and it was truncated on the right, so (0,2) changed to 5.\n\nIn example 3, the blocks moved left.\n\nIn example 1, no movement, perhaps because the blocks are not at the edge or something.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each contiguous block of non-zero cells in a row, we keep only the left part of the block, and the right part is changed to 5, but also, we might add cells on the left if possible.\n\nIn example 3, for row 4, we added a cell on the left (col0) and removed one on the right (col5).\n\nSimilarly for row 2, added col1 and removed col4.\n\nFor row 0, removed col3, no addition.\n\nIn example 2, removed the rightmost cell.\n\nIn example 1, no change.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is to shift the non-zero blocks to the left as much as possible, but without exceeding the original block's length or something.\n\nLet's see the number of cells.\n\nIn example 2 input: block size 3, output size 2, so reduced.\n\nIn example 3 row 0: input size 4, output size 3, reduced.\n\nRow 2: input size 3, output size 3, same size but shifted.\n\nRow 4: input size 5, output size 5, same size but shifted.\n\nIn row 4 output, size is 5, same as input.\n\nIn row 2, size is 3, same.\n\nIn row 0, size reduced from 4 to 3.\n\nPerhaps it's about making the block start from the leftmost possible position.\n\nIn example 3 row 4 input: starts at col1, ends at col5.\n\nOutput: starts at col0, ends at col4, so moved left by one column.\n\nSimilarly for row 2 input: starts at col2, ends at col4.\n\nOutput: starts at col1, ends at col3, moved left by one column.\n\nFor row 0 input: starts at col0, ends at col3.\n\nOutput: starts at col0, ends at col2, so moved left? No, start is same, end moved left, so size reduced.\n\nIn example 2, input starts at col0, ends at col2, output starts at col0, ends at col1, so size reduced.\n\nIn example 1, the blocks don't start at col0, so no change? Row1 block starts at col2, not 0, and no change. Row4 block starts at col1, not 0, no change.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each row, if there is a non-zero block, we try to shift it left until it hits the left boundary or another block, but in the examples, the blocks are isolated.\n\nIn the output, the non-zero cells are always contiguous in rows.\n\nPerhaps for each row, the non-zero cells are replaced with a left-aligned block of the same value, with the same number of cells as the original block or reduced if at boundary.\n\nIn example 2, original block size 3, but since it's at row 0, and perhaps we can't shift left, so we keep it left-aligned but reduce size? But in output, it's still at col0-1, so size 2, not 3.\n\nIn example 3 row 0: original size 4, output size 3, not left-aligned? It is left-aligned at col0, but size reduced.\n\nRow 2: original size 3, output size 3, left-aligned at col1? Not col0, so not fully left-aligned.\n\nIn row 2 output, it starts at col1, not 0.\n\nSimilarly in row 4 output, starts at col0.\n\nPerhaps the block is shifted left by a certain amount.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that each cell is set to the value of the cell to its left or something, but that doesn't fit.\n\nLet's look at the values around.\n\nPerhaps it's a convolution or kernel operation.\n\nNotice that in the output, for cells that were zero, they are set to 5, except when they are adjacent to non-zero cells and become part of the block.\n\nIn example 3, (2,1) was 0, became 7, and (4,0) was 0, became 7.\n\nSo cells to the left of the block might be set to the non-zero value if possible.\n\nSimilarly, cells to the right might be set to 5.\n\nIn example 3 row 0, (0,3) was 7, became 5, so right end.\n\nIn row 2, (2,4) was 7, became 5, right end.\n\n(2,1) was 0, became 7, left side.\n\nIn row 4, (4,5) was 7, became 5, right end, (4,0) was 0, became 7, left side.\n\nIn example 2, (0,2) was 4, became 5, right end, and no cell to the left since col0 is already non-zero.\n\nIn example 1, no change because the blocks are not at the edge, so no room to shift.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each contiguous block of non-zero cells in a row, we shift the entire block left by one cell if possible, meaning we set the cell immediately to the left of the block to the non-zero value, and set the cell at the right end of the block to 5. If the block is already at the left boundary, we only set the right end to 5, reducing the size.\n\nIn example 3 row 4: block from col1 to5, shift left: set col0 to 7 (since left cell), set col5 to 5, so new block col0 to4.\n\nSimilarly for row 2: block col2 to4, shift left: set col1 to 7, set col4 to 5, new block col1 to3.\n\nFor row 0: block col0 to3, already at left boundary, so can't shift left, so set the right end col3 to 5, new block col0 to2.\n\nIn example 2: block col0 to2, at left boundary, so set right end col2 to 5, new block col0 to1.\n\nIn example 1: for row1 block col2 to5, not at left boundary, so should shift left: set col1 to 3? But in output, col1 is 0 in input, and in output, row1 col1 is 3? Let's check example 1 output.\n\nExample 1 input row1: [0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0] so col1 is 0, col2-5 are 3.\n\nOutput row1: [5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5] so col1 is 3, which was 0, so set to 3, and col5 is 5, which was 3, so set to 5. And col6 and7 are 5, but they were 0, so background.\n\nIn output, for row1, the block is now col1 to4? col1 to4 are 3, col5 is 5.\n\nInput block was col2 to5, output block col1 to4, so shifted left by one: set col1 to 3, set col5 to 5.\n\nSimilarly, for the other block in row4: input [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] so block col1 and2 are 3.\n\nOutput [3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5] so col1 and2 are 3, col3 is 5. Input col3 was 0, output is 5, which is background, but the block didn't shift left because col0 was 0, and in output, col0 is 3? Output row4: [3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5] so col0 is 3, which was 0 in input, so set to 3, and col2 is 3, but col3 is 5.\n\nInput block col1 and2, output col0 and1 are 3? col0 and1 are 3 in output, but input col0 was 0, col1 was 3.\n\nSo for row4, block shifted left: set col0 to 3, and since the block size might be maintained or something.\n\nInput block size 2, output block size 2? col0 and1 are 3, so size 2, and col2 is 5, which was 0, but col2 was part of the block? No, input col2 is 3, but in output col2 is 5, so the right end was set to 5.\n\nInput: col1 and2 are 3, so block col1 to2.\n\nOutput: col0 and1 are 3, col2 is 5, so shifted left: set col0 to 3, set col2 to 5, so new block col0 to1.\n\nSize reduced from 2 to 2? No, input size 2, output size 2, but position changed.\n\nIn example 1, for row4, input block col1-2, output block col0-1, so shifted left by one column, size same.\n\nSimilarly for row1, input block col2-5 (size 4), output block col1-4 (size 4), shifted left by one.\n\nIn example 2, input block col0-2 (size 3), but output block col0-1 (size 2), so when at left boundary, size reduced.\n\nIn example 3 row0, input block col0-3 (size 4), output block col0-2 (size 3), at left boundary, size reduced.\n\nRow2, input block col2-4 (size 3), output block col1-3 (size 3), shifted left.\n\nRow4, input block col1-5 (size 5), output block col0-4 (size 5), shifted left.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each contiguous block of non-zero cells in a row, we attempt to shift the block left by one cell. This means:\n\n- Set the cell immediately to the left of the block to the non-zero value (if it exists and is within bounds).\n\n- Set the cell at the right end of the block to 5.\n\n- The cells that were zero and not adjacent might become 5 later, but in the output, all other cells are set to 5.\n\nIn the shifting process, we only change the cells at the left and right ends of the block.\n\nAfter shifting, the entire grid is filled with 5 for cells not part of any non-zero block.\n\nIn the examples, after shifting, the non-zero blocks are updated, and all other cells are 5.\n\nNow for the test case.\n\nFirst, identify all rows with non-zero blocks.\n\nTest case input: 10x10 grid.\n\nRow 0: [0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0] so non-zero block from col2 to col6 (5 cells: col2,3,4,5,6 have 6)\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0] so non-zero block from col6 to col7? col6 and col7 have 6, so block col6 to7 (2 cells)\n\nRow 4: [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0] so non-zero block from col1 to col3 (3 cells: col1,2,3 have 6)\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6] so non-zero block from col4 to col9 (6 cells: col4,5,6,7,8,9 have 6)\n\nOther rows are all zero.\n\nNow, for each row with a block, apply the shift left operation.\n\nFirst, row 0: block from col2 to col6.\n\nWe want to shift left by one: set the cell to the left of the block to 6. The block starts at col2, so left cell is col1. col1 is currently 0, set it to 6.\n\nSet the right end of the block to 5. The block ends at col6, so set col6 to 5.\n\nThe new block should be from col1 to col5? After shifting, the cells that were part of the block except the right end become the new block, but with the left cell added.\n\nAfter shift: col1 becomes 6 (was 0), col2 to5 remain 6? But col6 was 6, set to 5.\n\nSo the new non-zero cells are col1 to5: all 6, and col6 is 5.\n\nBut col0 is still 0, which will be set to 5 later.\n\nIn the output, we need to set all cells to 5 except the new non-zero blocks.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, row 2: block from col6 to col7.\n\nShift left: set left cell to 6. Block starts at col6, left cell is col5. col5 is currently 0, set it to 6.\n\nSet right end to 5. Block ends at col7, set col7 to 5.\n\nNew block: col5 to col6? col5 becomes 6, col6 was 6, remains? But we set col7 to 5, so col6 is still part of the block? After shift, the non-zero cells should be col5 and col6, both 6, and col7 is 5.\n\nBut col6 was already 6, so it remains 6.\n\nNow, row 4: block from col1 to col3.\n\nShift left: set left cell to 6. Block starts at col1, left cell is col0. col0 is 0, set to 6.\n\nSet right end to 5. Block ends at col3, set col3 to 5.\n\nNew block: col0 to col2? col0 becomes 6, col1 and col2 were 6, remain, col3 set to 5.\n\nSo col0,1,2 are 6, col3 is 5.\n\nNow, row 7: block from col4 to col9.\n\nShift left: set left cell to 6. Block starts at col4, left cell is col3. col3 is 0, set to 6.\n\nSet right end to 5. Block ends at col9, set col9 to 5.\n\nNew block: col3 to col8? col3 becomes 6, col4 to8 were 6, remain, col9 set to 5.\n\nSo col3 to8 are 6, col9 is 5.\n\nNow, for all other cells, they are set to 5.\n\nAlso, for rows without blocks, they are all 5.\n\nNow, we need to construct the output grid.\n\nFirst, initialize a 10x10 grid with all 5, since background is 5.\n\nThen, for each row, update the non-zero cells based on the shift.\n\nBut the shift might affect cells in different rows independently, but since the operations are per row, it should be fine.\n\nIn the output, for cells that are not part of any block, they are 5.\n\nNow, for row 0: after shift, non-zero cells are col1 to5 with 6.\n\nBut col6 was part of block, now set to 5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's define the output row by row.\n\nRow 0: originally [0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0]\n\nAfter shift: set col1 to 6 (left cell), set col6 to 5 (right end), so cells: col0:0 but will be 5, col1:6, col2:6, col3:6, col4:6, col5:6, col6:5, col7:0->5, col8:0->5, col9:0->5\n\nBut since we set all to 5 except the new block, so for row 0, the new block is col1 to5 with 6, so output: col0:5, col1:6, col2:6, col3:6, col4:6, col5:6, col6:5, col7:5, col8:5, col9:5\n\nSimilarly, row 1: all zero, so all 5.\n\nRow 2: originally [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0]\n\nAfter shift: set left cell col5 to 6, set right end col7 to 5.\n\nNew block: col5 and col6 with 6.\n\nSo output: col0:5, col1:5, col2:5, col3:5, col4:5, col5:6, col6:6, col7:5, col8:5, col9:5\n\nRow 3: all zero, all 5.\n\nRow 4: originally [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nAfter shift: set left cell col0 to 6, set right end col3 to 5.\n\nNew block: col0,1,2 with 6.\n\nSo output: col0:6, col1:6, col2:6, col3:5, col4:5, col5:5, col6:5, col7:5, col8:5, col9:5\n\nRow 5: all zero, all 5.\n\nRow 6: all zero, all 5.\n\nRow 7: originally [0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6]\n\nAfter shift: set left cell col3 to 6, set right end col9 to 5.\n\nNew block: col3 to8 with 6.\n\nSo output: col0:5, col1:5, col2:5, col3:6, col4:6, col5:6, col6:6, col7:6, col8:6, col9:5\n\nRow 8: all zero, all 5.\n\nRow 9: all zero, all 5.\n\nNow, we have the output grid.\n\nBut in the training examples, for rows with multiple blocks, but in this case, each row has at most one block, so no issue.\n\nIn example 1, there are two blocks in different rows, handled separately.\n\nSo for the test case, the output should be as above.\n\nNow, to write it in the format.\n\nAlso, in the shifting, we assume that the block is contiguous, which it is.\n\nNow, for the confidence, I think this pattern fits the training examples.\n\nIn example 1, for row1: block col2-5, shift left: set col1 to 3, set col5 to 5, new block col1-4.\n\nIn output, row1: [5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5] so yes, col1-4 are 3, col5 is 5.\n\nFor row4: block col1-2, shift left: set col0 to 3, set col2 to 5, new block col0-1.\n\nIn output, row4: [3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5] so col0-1 are 3, col2 is 5.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIn example 2: row0 block col0-2, at left boundary, so set right end col2 to 5, new block col0-1.\n\nOutput: [4,4,5] so yes.\n\nIn example 3 row0: block col0-3, at left boundary, so set right end col3 to 5, new block col0-2.\n\nOutput: [7,7,7,5,5,5,5] so col0-2 are 7, col3 is 5.\n\nRow2: block col2-4, shift left: set col1 to 7, set col4 to 5, new block col1-3.\n\nOutput: [5,7,7,7,5,5,5] so col1-3 are 7, col4 is 5.\n\nRow4: block col1-5, shift left: set col0 to 7, set col5 to 5, new block col0-4.\n\nOutput: [7,7,7,7,7,5,5] so col0-4 are 7, col5 is 5.\n\nAll match.\n\nSo for test case, same pattern.\n\nNow, for the output grid.\n\nAs above.\n\nSo predicted output:\n\nRow 0: [5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5]\n\nBut in my earlier, I have col1 to5 as 6, so indices: col0:5, col1:6, col2:6, col3:6, col4:6, col5:6, col6:5, col7:5, col8:5, col9:5\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, to write the full grid.\n\nAlso, in the output, for rows without blocks, all 5.\n\nSo the output should be a 10x10 grid.\n\nNow, for the JSON response.\n\nI need to provide pattern description, solving strategy, hints, and confidence.\n\nPattern description: The transformation shifts each contiguous block of non-zero cells left by one cell if possible, by setting the cell to the left of the block to the non-zero value and setting the cell at the right end of the block to 5. If the block is already at the left boundary, only the right end is set to 5, reducing the block size. All other cells are set to 5.\n\nSolving strategy: Applied the shift left operation to each row with non-zero blocks in the test case input.\n\nHints: Key insights are about left-shifting blocks and setting background to 5.\n\nConfidence: High, say 95, since it fits all training examples.\n\nNow, output the predicted grid.\n\nFirst, list the output rows.\n\nFrom above:\n\nRow 0: [5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // all 5\n\nRow 2: [5,5,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5]  // col5 and col6 are 6\n\nRow 3: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // all 5\n\nRow 4: [6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // col0,1,2 are 6\n\nRow 5: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // all 5\n\nRow 6: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // all 5\n\nRow 7: [5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5]  // col3 to8 are 6\n\nRow 8: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // all 5\n\nRow 9: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  // all 5\n\nNow, to write in the JSON.\n\nThe solving strategy should include the step-by-step reasoning and the predicted output.\n\nIn the JSON, \"solvingStrategy\" should be a string with the explanation.\n\nAnd \"hints\" as array of strings.\n\nConfidence as number.\n\nNow, for the response.",
