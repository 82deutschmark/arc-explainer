      "reasoningLog": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation pattern from the given ARC-like puzzle. It's interesting that we start with 3x3 matrices and end up with 6x6 matrices. The outputs seem to be organized in a 2x2 tiling. The top-left appears to copy the original, while the other sections might involve some mirroring or transformation.\n\nFor instance, the first input row is just repeated, the second row shows a reversal, and the third row being uniform is repeated again. The bottom half looks like a vertical mirror of the top half, which is quite intriguing!\n**Examining matrix transformation**\n\nI’m looking at how rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 align with the input. It seems row 1 stays the same as [2,5,2], while row 2 turns into [4,6,2], which is the reversal of row 2, and row 3 remains the same. This suggests the top-right section is a horizontal mirror of the top-left.\n\nNow for the bottom-left, rows 4-6 are indeed a vertical mirror of the top-left. They match the original rows in reverse order. Lastly, I'm considering the bottom-right section, which might be a double mirror or even a rotation of the top-left pattern.\n**Clarifying matrix transformations**\n\nI noticed that row 5, column 4-6 does equal a vertical mirror and not just a horizontal one. For the bottom-right section to match, it looks like row 4 from the bottom-left remains unchanged when reversed, row 5 becomes its mirror version, and row 6 stays the same as well. \n\nSo, the pattern expands the 3x3 matrix to 6x6 by arranging it into four quadrants: top-left is the original, top-right is its horizontal mirror, bottom-left is the vertical mirror, and bottom-right combines both types of mirroring, effectively rotating the original by 180 degrees. Now I’ll check Example 2 to verify this pattern!\n**Verifying matrix symmetry**\n\nFor Example 2, I noticed row 2 ends up as [1,7,7], which matches the reversed version correctly. It’s nice that rows 4-6 in the bottom-left mirrored the top-left section vertically.\n\nMoving to Example 3, I see row 1 remains symmetrical, and row 2's reversal shows up correctly as [1,8,2]. For row 3, it mirrors well. \n\nAs I check Example 4, I confirm row 1 repeats neatly when reversed. Rows 2 and 3 also seem consistent. Overall, the pattern continues to hold across these examples!\n{\n  \"patternDescription\": \"Reflect a 3x3 grid across its right edge horizontally and across its bottom edge vertically, forming a 6x6 symmetrical tiling: TL=original, TR=horizontal mirror, BL=vertical mirror, BR=both mirrors.\",\n  \"solvingStrategy\": \"1) Copy input as TL block. 2) Create TR by reversing each row. 3) Create BL by reversing row order. 4) Create BR by reversing both row order and row elements.
