  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves identifying repeating patterns in the input grid and simplifying them into a more uniform structure. The output grid retains the core repeating elements (like 2x2 blocks of numbers) but removes irregularities and extra elements, resulting in a cleaner, more structured grid. The key is to identify the repeating units and replicate them in a consistent manner across the grid.",
  "keySteps": [
    "1. Observe the input grid for repeating patterns or structures.",
    "2. Identify the core elements that are consistently repeated (e.g., 2x2 blocks of 2s, 3s, 8s).",
    "3. Note the positions of these repeating elements and their arrangement.",
    "4. Simplify the grid by removing irregularities and extra elements that do not fit the repeating pattern.",
    "5. Replicate the core repeating units in a consistent manner to form the output grid.",
    "6. Ensure the output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid."

    "1. For each 2x2 block in the input, if it matches a core pattern, copy it to the output. 2. Otherwise, fill the output block with zeros. 3. Repeat for all blocks.",
