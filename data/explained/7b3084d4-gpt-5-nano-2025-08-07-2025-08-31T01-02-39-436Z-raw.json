  "solvingStrategy": "Identify left-right distribution of colors in the input (left side: 2,7,5; right side: 3,8). Within each side, identify top vs bottom distribution (2 is top-left; 7 and 5 occupy bottom-left; 3 is top-right; 8 is bottom-right). The overall output forms a 2x2 mosaic of equal-sized blocks whose side length equals the extent of each half (7 in this case, since left and right halves each provide 7-wide blocks). Thus the final mosaic is 14x14, arranged as: top-left block filled with 2, top-right block filled with 3, bottom-left block filled with 7 (with a single 5 included at the bottom-right boundary to reflect 5â€™s presence inside the left-bottom region), bottom-right block filled with 8. This matches the observed pattern in training examples where the four quadrants correspond to left-top, right-top, left-bottom, and right-bottom color groups and the resulting composite grid preserves color identities and relative placements within each quadrant.",
