      "solvingStrategy": "I studied the three training examples carefully and observed that in every grid the center column (all 7‚Äôs) remains unchanged, while cells on the outer parts (especially in rows above and below the middle) are modified. In each example only a few non‚Äêcenter positions change, and their new values appear to be taken from numbers found on the opposite border or in positions that would be obtained by a kind of reflection. Although several approaches (such as reflecting indices, swapping outer ring elements or computing differences) were attempted, a unique clear rule was not entirely unambiguous. I therefore interpreted the transformation as one that leaves the grid structure intact except for a few cells in the outer ‚Äúring‚Äù that are replaced by digits that mirror the opposite border values. Based on similar patterns in the training cases, I applied an analogous transformation to the test grid.",
      "keySteps": [
        "Noted that the middle column, which is full of 7‚Äôs, remains unchanged in all examples.",
        "Identified that only some cells in the outer parts (first few and last few rows) are modified while the rest of the grid is retained.",
        "Examined different possible reflection and rotation rules based on positions from the input grid‚Äôs border.",
        "Tested ideas such as mirroring positions across the grid center and using corresponding border values.",
        "Due to some ambiguity in the pattern, synthesized a plausible rule that in rows above or below the center, one or two cells are replaced with values coming from the opposite border (for example, top‚Äêleft replaced by bottom‚Äêright, and similarly for other positions).",
        "Applied this reasoning to the test case to produce a grid that is nearly identical to the input except that in one of the rows below the center and in the bottom row one element is modified."
      ],
      "patternDescription": "The observed pattern is that the grids remain largely unchanged except for selected cells off the center column that are replaced by numbers taken from opposite border positions. In particular, the center column remains all 7‚Äôs while some outer cells (often at a symmetric relative position to the grid center) appear to have been replaced by the corresponding element of the opposite edge of the grid. This creates a subtle mirroring effect between the top and bottom parts of the grid.",
      "hints": [
        "Algorithm: For each cell not in the center column, if the cell lies in the upper half then replace it with the element from the position (grid_size-1-r, grid_size-1-c) from the input; if in the lower half, use the corresponding value from the opposite edge. Preserve the center column exactly.",
        "Math description: Keep column 2 constant; for a cell (r, c) with c != 2, set output(r,c) = f(r,c) where f mirrors border values from the cell (4-r,4-c) in a 5√ó5 grid, with minor adjustments depending on whether r is above or below the center.",
