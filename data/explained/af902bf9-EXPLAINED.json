In Example 1, two 4s vertically aligned in column 3 and 5 create a center cell between their rows; a single 2 appears midway between them horizontally at their mid-column (col 4) due to symmetric placement, effectively marking the center of the bounding box formed by that pair. In Example 2, two rows (r1 and r6) each have 4s at c1 and c7, creating a rectangular band between rows r2–r5 and columns c3–c6 which becomes filled with 2s (a solid rectangle) bordered by the 4s rows and columns. In Example 3, two columns (c2 and c4) each have 4s at r2 and r4, yielding a thin vertical rectangle between them at r3,c3 filled with a single 2; similarly, in the lower-right, two rows (r7 and r10) with 4s at c5 and c10 create a band between r8–r9 and c6–c9 filled with 2s. Thus the rule: find pairs of parallel lines (rows or columns) that contain symmetric 4s such that they define an empty rectangular band between them; fill that interior with 2s. Apply to test: There are two vertical pairs of rows with matching 4s forming horizontal bands: rows 5 and 9 have 4s at columns 1 and 4; between them (rows 6–8) and between columns 2–3, fill a 3x2 block of 2s aligned with the inner area; also rows 1 and 5 have 4s at columns 6 and 10, creating a band between rows 2–4 and columns 7–9; fill that 3x3 with 2s. Additionally, where a single vertical alignment exists with two 4s in same column separated by empty rows (rows 1 and 5 at column 6), fill the rectangle between their neighbor columns constrained by paired 4 columns (columns 6 and 10), giving a 3x2 addition tying into the 3x3. The resulting filled regions: a 3x5 area from r2–r4, c4–8 would be overreach, so limit to the largest axis-aligned rectangles whose borders are defined by pairs of 4s in both orientations. Final filled blocks: - Upper-right: rows 2–4, cols 7–9 set to 2. - Middle-left: rows 6–8, cols 2–3 set to 2. - Additionally, the shared row 5 between vertical pairs creates a single-row extension at row5, cols 4 and 7–8; respect symmetry to add row5, cols4 and 7–8 as 2 where both bordering pairs exist.
