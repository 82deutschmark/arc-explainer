      "patternDescription": "The 3 × 3 picture is copied three times in a straight line, giving either a tall 3 × 9 column or a wide 9 × 3 row.  If the little picture already contains two identical rows the line is made top-to-bottom (vertical); otherwise it is made left-to-right (horizontal).  All other squares of the 9 × 9 board are left empty (⬛).",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Change the emojis back to ordinary numbers so comparing is easier.  \n2. Compare the three rows of the 3 × 3 input:\n   • When you find that any two rows are exactly the same, decide on a VERTICAL strip; you will stack the picture three times under one another.\n   • If no two rows match, decide on a HORIZONTAL strip; you will put the picture three times side-by-side.\n3. Tiling:  copy the whole 3 × 3 block three times in the chosen direction.  This gives either 9 rows ×3 columns (vertical case) or 3 rows ×9 columns (horizontal case).\n4. Position the strip inside the 9 × 9 board.  Place it in the first 3-row/3-column slot you reach when you read the big board in the natural order (top→bottom, left→right).  This reproduces the exact locations used in every example.\n5. Finally, fill every other cell with 0 (⬛).  The result is the published answer.",
      "hints": [
        "Turn the emojis back into plain numbers first – it is much easier to see which rows match.",
        "Check whether two of the three little rows are identical; that single fact already tells you whether the final strip is vertical or horizontal.",
        "After the strip has been built, everything else in the 9 × 9 canvas must stay ⬛."

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens appear to be showing how one short message can be *broadcast* in a single direction, almost like sending the same radio pulse over and over while keeping silence everywhere else.  Using 🛸 (their ship emoji, 6) and 🪐 (their-home emoji, 4) together with the human symbol 👤 (3) might be a playful way of saying: «We can line up our ships and planets in whichever direction we choose.»  It feels more like a demonstration of ability than a threat – a friendly ‘look what we can do’.",
