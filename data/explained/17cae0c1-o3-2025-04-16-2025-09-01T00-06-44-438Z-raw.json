  "solvingStrategy": "1. Each 3√ó9 input grid is split into three 3√ó3 blocks (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8). 2. Every training output paints each 3√ó3 block with a single colour, the same across all three rows, so the task is to identify which solid colour belongs to which 3√ó3 pattern of 5-pixels. 3. From the four training examples we gathered the following dictionary:   ‚Ä¢ pattern ‚Äúall 5s except the centre‚Äù ‚Üí 3   ‚Ä¢ pattern ‚Äúonly centre is 5‚Äù         ‚Üí 4   ‚Ä¢ pattern ‚Äúanti-diagonal 5s‚Äù         ‚Üí 9   ‚Ä¢ pattern ‚Äúbottom row all 5s‚Äù        ‚Üí 1   ‚Ä¢ pattern ‚Äútop row all 5s‚Äù           ‚Üí 6 4. For the test input the three blocks are:   ‚Ä¢ Block1 (cols 0-2): bottom row full of 5s ‚Üí colour 1   ‚Ä¢ Block2 (cols 3-5): anti-diagonal of 5s   ‚Üí colour 9   ‚Ä¢ Block3 (cols 6-8): top row full of 5s    ‚Üí colour 6 5. Fill each 3√ó3 block with its colour and copy the same row three times to obtain the 3√ó9 output.",
