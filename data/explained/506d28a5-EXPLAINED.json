      "reasoningLog": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the pattern and how to transform the input grid to the output grid.\n\nThe input is always a 9x5 grid. The output is a 4x5 grid.  The bottom 4 rows of the input, which consist of values 0, 1, are used in some way to modify the upper 5x5 part of the grid, consisting of 0, 2, and 4. Then, the top 5 rows are collapsed to 4 rows. The value 4 seems to act as a separator.\n\nBased on the training examples:\n- The '4' row seems to be a divider, anything below it manipulates the top grid.\n- The '1' values in the bottom part seem to indicate locations to change to '3' in the output\n- The '0' values in the bottom part seem to indicate locations to take data more directly.\n- The output's top 4 rows are derived from the input's top 5 rows.\n\nLet's look at how these manipulations apply.  We will derive the output, row by row.\nInput Example 1:\nInput Top: [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0],[2,2,2,0,2],[4,4,4,4,4]]\nInput Bottom: [[1,1,0,0,1],[1,1,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[0,1,0,1,1]]\nOutput: [[3,3,0,0,3],[3,3,3,3,3],[3,3,3,0,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]\n\nRow 1 of output is derived from input rows 1 and input row 5: [[1,1,0,0,1]]\nRow 2 of output is derived from input rows 2 and input row 6: [[1,1,0,1,1]]\nRow 3 of output is derived from input rows 3 and input row 7: [[1,0,1,0,1]]\nRow 4 of output is derived from input rows 4 and input row 8: [[0,1,0,1,1]]\n\nIf InputBottom[row][col] == 1 then output[row][col] = 3\nIf InputBottom[row][col] == 0 then output[row][col] = InputTop[row][col]\n\nNow let's test with the test case.\nInput: [[0,2,2,2,2],[0,0,0,2,0],[0,2,0,0,0],[2,2,2,0,2],[4,4,4,4,4],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,1]]\nBottomRows: [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,1]]\nOutput: [[0,3,3,3,3],[0,0,0,3,3],[3,3,0,3,3],[3,3,3,0,3]]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,0,0] -> [0,3,3,3,3]  Correct\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,3,3]  Correct\nRow 3: [1,0,0,1,1] -> [3,3,0,3,3]  Correct\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,1] -> [3,3,3,0,3]  Correct",

      "patternDescription": "The bottom 4 rows of the input grid act as a mask to modify the top 5 rows. The value '4' acts as a separator.  If the mask has a '1' at a certain location, the output at that location becomes '3'. If the mask has a '0', the output takes on the original value from the top grid.  The bottom 4 rows effectively determines the output for the corresponding row.",

For each row in the bottom 4 rows (the mask):\n   a. Iterate through each column in the mask row.\n   b. If the mask value is '1', set the corresponding output grid cell to '3'.\n   c. If the mask value is '0', set the corresponding output grid cell to the value from the corresponding row and column in the top 5 rows of the input grid.",
