      "model": "deepseek-reasoner",
      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to find the pattern of transformation from input to output. The inputs and outputs are grids with numbers, mostly 2 and 4, but in the outputs, some cells change to 8.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has values 2 and 4. Output has some 8s where there were 4s or 2s? Let's compare.\n\nIn Example 1 output, the changes are:\n\n- Row 4, column 9: input was 4, output is 8? Wait, let's index properly. Rows and columns start from 0.\n\nActually, in the output grid, I see 8s appearing. For instance, in row 4 (5th row if 1-based, but in code it's 0-based), but let's list the changes.\n\nFrom input to output in Example 1:\n\n- Input row 4: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,2] → output row 4: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,2,2] so at column 9 (0-based: index 9), input was 4, output is 8.\n\nSimilarly, row 5: input [4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4,4,2] → output [4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,8,8,8,2] so at columns 8,9,10, input had 4,4,4 → output 8,8,8.\n\nRow 6: input [2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2] → output [2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,8,2,2] so at column 9, input 4 → output 8.\n\nOther rows seem unchanged.\n\nSo in Example 1, some 4s are changed to 8s, but not all. It seems related to groups or clusters of 4s.\n\nNow Example 2:\n\nInput has 2s and 4s, output has some 8s.\n\nLooking at output, 8s appear in places where there are patterns. For example, in row 2: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] → output [2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2] so 4s changed to 8s.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: input [2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2] → output [2,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,2,2] so groups of 4s become 8s.\n\nBut not all 4s are changed; for example, in row 5: [4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4] → output same, no change? In output, row 5 is still [4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4] so no 8s here.\n\nSo in Example 2, the 4s that are changed to 8s are in specific positions, perhaps where there are horizontal or vertical groups.\n\nIn row 2, the 4s are isolated or in a pattern? Let's see the grid.\n\nActually, in Example 2 input, there are repeating patterns. Notice that rows 0,1,9,10,14 have similar patterns, and in those, 4s are not changed to 8s, but in rows 2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13, the 4s are changed to 8s.\n\nBut rows 2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13 have 4s that are part of groups? Row 2 has single 4s, but they are changed to 8s. Row 3 has groups of three 4s, changed to 8s.\n\nBut row 5 has 4s that are not changed, and row 5 has 4s in positions that might be different.\n\nPerhaps it's about the context. Maybe 4s are changed to 8s only if they are adjacent to other 4s in a certain way, but in row 2, the 4s are not adjacent to other 4s? In row 2, the 4s are at index 3,8,13, and between them are 2s, so they are isolated, but still changed to 8s. That doesn't make sense for adjacency.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's based on the pattern of the grid. Notice that in Example 2, the grid seems to have a periodic pattern. Let's list the rows.\n\nRow 0: [4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4] → no change\n\nRow 1: same as row 0 → no change\n\nRow 2: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] → changed to 8s at 4 positions\n\nRow 3: [2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2] → changed to 8s\n\nRow 4: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] → changed to 8s\n\nRow 5: [4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4] → no change\n\nRow 6: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] → changed to 8s\n\nRow 7: [2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2] → changed to 8s\n\nRow 8: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] → changed to 8s\n\nRow 9: same as row 0 → no change\n\nRow 10: same → no change\n\nRow 11: same as row 2 → changed to 8s\n\nRow 12: same as row 3 → changed to 8s\n\nRow 13: same as row 4 → changed to 8s\n\nRow 14: same as row 5 → no change\n\nSo the rows that are changed are rows 2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13. What is common about these rows? They all have the number 4 in them, but row 5 also has 4s and not changed.\n\nNotice that row 5 has a different pattern: it has 4s at positions where it might be part of a block, but let's see the values.\n\nPerhaps it's about the row pattern. Row 0,1,9,10,14 have a pattern with groups of 4s, but they are not changed, while rows like 2 have single 4s separated by 2s, and they are changed.\n\nBut in row 3, there are groups of 4s, and they are changed to groups of 8s.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the transformation is that 4s are changed to 8s only if they are not adjacent to a 2 in a certain way, but that doesn't hold.\n\nLet's look at the cells themselves. Perhaps it's about the connectivity or clusters.\n\nIn Example 1, let's find where 8s appear.\n\nIn Example 1 output, 8s appear at: (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9)\n\nNow, in input, these cells have value 4, except (5,10) has 4, etc.\n\nBut what is common? Let's see the neighbors.\n\nFor example, at (4,9), in input, it is 4, and its neighbors: left is 4, right is 2, up is 2, down is 4 (from row 5, column 9 is 4). So it has left and down as 4.\n\nSimilarly, at (5,8): input 4, neighbors: left is 2 (from row 5, col 7 is 2), right is 4 (col 9), up is 4 (row 4, col 8 is 4), down is 4 (row 6, col 8 is 2? Row 6: [2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2] so col 8 is 2? Let's list indices.\n\nRow 5: index 8 is the 9th element? Let's use 0-based indexing.\n\nDefine rows and columns from 0.\n\nExample 1 input has 10 rows, 12 columns.\n\nRow 4: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,2] so indices: col 8: 4, col 9:4\n\nRow 5: [4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4,4,2] so col 8:4, col 9:4, col 10:4\n\nRow 6: [2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2] so col 8:2, col 9:4, col 10:2\n\nIn output, row 5 col 8,9,10 become 8,8,8\n\nRow 4 col 9 becomes 8\n\nRow 6 col 9 becomes 8\n\nNow, for row 4 col 9: value 4, neighbors: left (col 8) is 4, right (col 10) is 2, up (row 3 col 9) is 4? Row 3: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,2] so col 9:4, down (row 5 col 9) is 4. So it has left, up, down as 4, right as 2.\n\nSimilarly for row 5 col 8: value 4, neighbors: left (col 7) is 2, right (col 9) is 4, up (row 4 col 8) is 4, down (row 6 col 8) is 2. So it has right and up as 4.\n\nBut not all neighbors are 4.\n\nPerhaps it's about being part of a group where multiple 4s are connected.\n\nIn Example 1, the cells that change to 8 are all in a cluster of 4s. Let's find the cluster.\n\nFrom row 4 col 8 and 9 are 4s, row 5 col 8,9,10 are 4s, row 6 col 9 is 4. So there is a group of 4s: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9). But in output, (4,8) remains 4, while (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9) become 8. Why (4,8) remains? In output, row 4 col 8 is still 4, from output: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,2,2] so col 8 is 4, col 9 is 8.\n\nSo (4,8) is 4 in output, but (4,9) is 8.\n\nWhat's the difference? Neighbors: (4,8) has left (col7) is 2, right (col9) is 4, up (row3 col8) is 4, down (row5 col8) is 4. So it has two adjacent 4s: right and down? But (4,9) has left (col8) is 4, right (col10) is 2, up (row3 col9) is 4, down (row5 col9) is 4. So both have multiple 4 neighbors.\n\nPerhaps it's about the number of adjacent 4s. But both have similar number.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's about being on a \"corner\" or something.\n\nLet's list all changed cells in Example 1: (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9)\n\nNow, let's see their values and neighbors.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4 and has at least two adjacent 4s in specific directions, but it's messy.\n\nLet's look at Example 3 for more clues.\n\nExample 3 input: 12 rows, 12 columns.\n\nOutput: changes to 8s at various places.\n\nFrom output: row 4 col 6 becomes 8? Input row 4: [2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] → output [2,2,2,2,2,4,8,4,4,4,4,4] so col 6: 4->8\n\nRow 5: input [2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,4] → output [2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,4] so col 5,6,7: 4->8\n\nRow 6: input [4,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,2,2,4] → output [4,2,2,2,2,2,8,4,2,2,2,4] so col 6: 4->8\n\nRow 7: input [4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4] → output [4,8,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4] so col 1: 4->8? col 1 is index 1, which is the second element. Row 7: [4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4] so col 0:4, col1:4, output col1:8\n\nRow 8: input [4,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,2,2] → output [8,8,8,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,2,2] so col 0,1,2: 4->8\n\nRow 9: input [4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2] → output [4,8,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2] so col 1:4->8\n\nSo in Example 3, changes happen at cells that are 4 and have adjacent 4s.\n\nBut let's find a pattern across examples.\n\nFrom all examples, it seems that cells with value 4 are changed to 8 if they are part of a group where there are multiple 4s connected, but not all cells in the group change; only some.\n\nIn Example 1, not all cells in the cluster change; (4,8) remains 4.\n\nIn Example 2, in row 3, all 4s change to 8s, but in row 2, only the 4s change to 8s, and they are single, but changed.\n\nIn row 2 of Example 2, the 4s are at col 3,8,13, and they are changed to 8s, but they are not connected to other 4s horizontally or vertically; they are isolated in their row, but in terms of grid, they might be connected vertically? Let's see the columns.\n\nIn Example 2, row 2 col 3: value 4, what is above and below? Row 1 col 3: from row 1 [4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4] so col 3 is 2? Let's see the list.\n\nRow 1: indices: 0:4,1:4,2:2,3:2,4:2,5:4,6:4,7:2,8:2,9:2,10:4,11:4,12:2,13:2,14:2,15:4,16:4 so col 3 is 2, not 4. Similarly, row 3 col 3 is 4? Row 3: [2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2] so col 3 is 4, but row 2 col 3 is 4, and row 3 col 3 is 4, so vertically adjacent? But row 2 col 3 has row 1 col 3 is 2, row 3 col 3 is 4, so it has one vertical neighbor below.\n\nBut in output, it is changed to 8.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that a cell with value 4 is changed to 8 if it has at least two adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are also 4, but in Example 2 row 2 col 3, it has only one adjacent cell that is 4 (below), since left and right are 2, up is 2, so only down is 4, so only one adjacent 4, but it is changed to 8. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's based on the number of 4s in a certain radius, but let's think differently.\n\nLet's list the cells that change in each example and see what they have in common.\n\nFrom Example 1: changed cells are (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9)\n\nAll these cells have value 4 in input.\n\nNow, let's see their coordinates. Perhaps it's about the row and column indices.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 4 and the cell to the left and right are both 4, or up and down, but in (4,9), left is 4, right is 2, so not both left and right. Up is 4, down is 4, so up and down are both 4? For (4,9), up (row3 col9) is 4, down (row5 col9) is 4, so yes, up and down are both 4. Similarly for (5,8): up (row4 col8) is 4, down (row6 col8) is 2, so not both up and down. Left is 2, right is 4, so not both left and right. So for (5,8), up and down are not both 4.\n\nBut it changed to 8.\n\nSo not that.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4 and both the cell to the left and the cell to the right are 4, then it changes, but in (5,8), left is 2, right is 4, so not both.\n\nNot that.\n\nLet's consider the surrounding cells in a cross pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's about the sum or average, but that might not be it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the grid is divided into blocks or something, but the sizes vary.\n\nLet's look at the test case input. It has 22 rows and 22 columns? Let's see the input: list of 22 lists, each with 22 elements.\n\nBut from training, examples have different sizes, so the pattern should be general.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 4, and if in its 3x3 neighborhood, there are at least 3 cells with value 4, then it changes to 8, but let's test with Example 1.\n\nFor (4,9): value 4, 3x3 neighborhood: from row 3 to 5, col 8 to 10.\n\nRow 3 col 8:4, col9:4, col10:2\n\nRow 4 col 8:4, col9:4, col10:2\n\nRow 5 col 8:4, col9:4, col10:4\n\nSo cells with value 4: (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10) — that's 7 cells, so more than 3, so it changes, good.\n\nFor (5,8): value 4, 3x3 neighborhood: row 4 to 6, col 7 to 9.\n\nRow 4 col7:2, col8:4, col9:4\n\nRow 5 col7:2, col8:4, col9:4\n\nRow 6 col7:2, col8:2, col9:4\n\nSo value 4 cells: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9) — that's 5 cells, so at least 3, changes.\n\nFor (6,9): value 4, 3x3 neighborhood: row 5 to 7, col 8 to 10.\n\nRow 5 col8:4, col9:4, col10:4\n\nRow 6 col8:2, col9:4, col10:2\n\nRow 7 col8:2, col9:2, col10:2? Row 7: [2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2] so col8:2, col9:2, col10:2\n\nSo value 4 cells: (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9) — that's 4 cells, so at least 3, changes.\n\nNow for (4,8) which did not change: value 4, 3x3 neighborhood: row 3 to 5, col 7 to 9.\n\nRow 3 col7:2, col8:4, col9:4\n\nRow 4 col7:2, col8:4, col9:4\n\nRow 5 col7:2, col8:4, col9:4\n\nSo value 4 cells: (3,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9) — that's 6 cells, so at least 3, but it did not change. So contradiction.\n\nSo not based on 3x3 neighborhood with at least 3 fours.\n\nPerhaps it's about the number of adjacent 4s in the four directions.\n\nFor (4,8): adjacent cells: left: col7=2, right: col9=4, up: row3 col8=4, down: row5 col8=4. So two adjacent 4s: right and down? up and down? up is 4, down is 4, so two adjacent 4s.\n\nBut it did not change.\n\nFor (4,9): adjacent cells: left: col8=4, right: col10=2, up: row3 col9=4, down: row5 col9=4. So three adjacent 4s: left, up, down.\n\nAnd it changed.\n\nFor (5,8): adjacent cells: left: col7=2, right: col9=4, up: row4 col8=4, down: row6 col8=2. So two adjacent 4s: right and up.\n\nAnd it changed. But (4,8) also has two adjacent 4s but did not change.\n\nSo not simply number of adjacent 4s.\n\nPerhaps it's about the pattern of the adjacent cells.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the cell changes to 8 if it is 4 and it is not the leftmost or something in a group, but let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the group of 4s: (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9). (4,8) is the leftmost in its row for the group? But (5,8) is also leftmost for the group in row 5, but it changed.\n\nPerhaps for each row, the 4s are changed if they are in a run of multiple 4s, but in Example 2, row 2 has single 4s but they are changed, so not.\n\nLet's consider Example 2 more carefully.\n\nIn Example 2, let's take a cell that changes, say row 2 col 3: value 4, what are its adjacent cells? Left: col2=2, right: col4=2, up: row1 col3=2, down: row3 col3=4. So only down is 4.\n\nBut it changes to 8. Why?\n\nPerhaps it is because down is 4, and down cell also has adjacent cells, but that might be recursive.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is that we identify all cells that are 4 and have another 4 directly below them, and then change those cells to 8, but in Example 1, (4,9) has down is 4, so it changes, (5,8) has down is 2, so not below, but it changes, so not.\n\nUnless it's below or above or left or right, but then all 4s with any adjacent would change, but not all do.\n\nLet's list all cells that change in Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the cells that change to 8 are all the 4s in rows 2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13, but only in the columns where there are 4s in those rows, but in row 3, all 4s change, in row 2, only the 4s change, etc.\n\nBut notice that in rows that change, the 4s are in columns that are multiple of something? Col 3,8,13 in row 2, which are similar to other rows.\n\nPerhaps the grid has a pattern where certain rows are \"active\" for change.\n\nBut in Example 1, there is no such obvious row pattern.\n\nLet's look at the difference between input and output for each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s only in a specific area.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 8s in the middle rows.\n\nIn Example 3, output has 8s in various places.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and if the cell to the left is 4 or the cell to the right is 4, and the cell above is 4 or below is 4, but let's test.\n\nFor (4,9) in Example 1: left is 4, right is 2, so left is 4, and above is 4, below is 4, so it changes.\n\nFor (5,8): left is 2, right is 4, so right is 4, and above is 4, below is 2, so above is 4, so it changes.\n\nFor (4,8): left is 2, right is 4, so right is 4, and above is 4, below is 4, so it should change, but it does not. So not.\n\nUnless it requires both left and right or both up and down, but for (4,8), left is 2, right is 4, so not both left and right; up is 4, down is 4, so both up and down, so it should change, but it doesn't. So not.\n\nI need to consider the value of the cells after change or something, but that might be circular.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that we change cell to 8 if it is 4 and it is surrounded by 4s in a way that it is not on the edge of a group, but from Example 1, (4,8) is on the edge, so not changed, while (4,9) is more interior, so changed.\n\nIn the group, (4,8) has left is 2, so it is on the left edge, while (4,9) has left is 4, right is 2, so it is on the right edge, but it changed, so not consistent.\n\n (4,9) has right is 2, so it is on the right edge, but changed.\n\n (5,8) has left is 2, so on left edge, and it changed.\n\n (5,9) has left and right are 4, so interior, changed.\n\n (5,10) has right is 2, so on right edge, changed.\n\n (6,9) has left and right are 2, so isolated in row, but changed.\n\nSo not about being on edge.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the number of 4s in the plus pattern (up, down, left, right) is at least 2, but for (4,8), plus pattern has left:2, right:4, up:4, down:4, so three 4s, so should change, but it doesn't.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the transformation is applied only to cells that are 4 and have a cell with value 2 above them or below them, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nFrom Example 2, in row 2, the cells have value 4, and above them are 2s, below them are 4s in row 3 for col 3, but for col 8, above is 2, below is 4, etc.\n\nBut in Example 1, for (4,9), above is 4, below is 4, so not below is 2.\n\nI recall that in some ARC puzzles, the transformation might be based on the binary representation or something, but here values are 2 and 4, which are powers of 2, and 8 is also power of 2, so perhaps it's about doubling if certain conditions are met.\n\nBut what conditions?\n\nLet's list the values around the cell.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and if the cell to the left is 2 and the cell to the right is 2, then it changes, but in Example 2 row 2 col 3, left is 2, right is 2, so it changes, yes! But in Example 1, for (4,9), left is 4, right is 2, so not both left and right are 2, so it should not change, but it does change, so not.\n\nUnless it's left and right are not both 4, but that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the cell changes to 8 if it is 4 and both the cell above and below are 4, but for (4,9) above and below are 4, so changes, for (5,8) above is 4, below is 2, so not both, but it changes, so not.\n\nFor (5,8), above is 4, below is 2, so not both above and below are 4.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's look at Example 3.\n\nIn Example 3, let's take a cell that changes, row 4 col 6: value 4, what are its adjacent cells? Left: col5=4, right: col7=4, up: row3 col6=2? Row 3: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] so col6=2, down: row5 col6=4? Row 5: [2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,4] so col6=4. So left and right are 4, up is 2, down is 4. So not both up and down are 4.\n\nBut it changes.\n\nNow for a cell that doesn't change, but in Example 3, many cells don't change, but let's find a cell that is 4 and doesn't change to 8. For example, row 0 col 5: value 4, does it change? Output row 0: [2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,4] so no change, still 4.\n\nWhat are its adjacent cells? Left: col4=2, right: col6=4, up: none? Row 0 is top row, so no up, down: row1 col5=4? Row 1: [2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,4] so col5=4. So left is 2, right is 4, down is 4, up is out of bound or considered 0? But typically in grid, we consider only within bounds.\n\nSo for row 0 col 5, adjacent cells: left=2, right=4, down=4. So it has two adjacent 4s, but not changed.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 col 5: value 4, adjacent: left=4, right=4, up=4, down=2? Row 2: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] so col5=2. So left, right, up are 4, down is 2. So three adjacent 4s, but not changed in output? Output row 1 is same as input, so no change.\n\nSo why are some cells changed and others not?\n\nIn Example 3, the cells that change are in rows 4,5,6,7,8,9 but not all cells in those rows.\n\nLet's list the changed cells in Example 3:\n\n- row 4 col 6: 4->8\n\n- row 5 col 5:4->8, col6:4->8, col7:4->8\n\n- row 6 col 6:4->8\n\n- row 7 col 1:4->8\n\n- row 8 col 0:4->8, col1:4->8, col2:4->8\n\n- row 9 col 1:4->8\n\nNow, let's see the surrounding for each.\n\nNotice that in row 5, col5,6,7 are all 4s, and they change to 8s, so it's a run of 4s.\n\nIn row 4, col6 is 4, but col5 and col7 are also 4, but only col6 changes? No, in row 4, only col6 changes, but col5 and col7 remain 4.\n\nIn row 4, input: col5=4, col6=4, col7=4, but output: col5=4, col6=8, col7=4, so only middle one changes? But in row 5, all three change.\n\nIn row 6, only col6 changes, but col5=2, col6=4, col7=4, so not a run.\n\nFor row 4 col6: it is part of a vertical run? col6 has row3 col6=2, row4 col6=4, row5 col6=4, so not vertical run.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell above is 2 and the cell below is 4, then it changes, but for row 4 col6, above is 2, below is 4, so changes, good.\n\nFor row 5 col5: above is row4 col5=4, below is row6 col5=2, so above is 4, below is 2, so not above 2 and below 4.\n\nBut it changes, so not.\n\nFor row 5 col5: above is 4, below is 2, so if above is 4 and below is 2, then change? But for row 4 col5, above is row3 col5=2, below is row5 col5=4, so above is 2, below is 4, so it should change, but it does not change in output.\n\nRow 4 col5 remains 4.\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that we change cell to 8 if it is 4 and it is the bottom of a vertical run of 4s or something.\n\nLet's consider the test case input. Maybe from the test case, we can find a pattern.\n\nThe test case input is large, so manually checking might be hard, but let's see if there are obvious patterns.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that a cell with value 4 is changed to 8 if it has exactly two adjacent cells that are 4, but from Example 1, (4,8) has two adjacent 4s but not changed, while (5,8) has two adjacent 4s and changed, so not.\n\nUnless it's about the type of adjacency.\n\nLet's think about the difference between input and output in terms of values.\n\nIn all outputs, the values are either 2,4, or 8, and 8 only appears where there was 4.\n\nSo only 4s are changed to 8s under some conditions.\n\nNow, from Example 2, in the rows where changes happen, the 4s are changed to 8s, but in rows like row 5, no changes, so perhaps it depends on the row index.\n\nIn Example 2, the rows that change are rows 2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13. What is common about these row indices? They are not multiple of 5 or something? Row 2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13. Not obvious.\n\nPerhaps it's about the pattern of the row itself.\n\nNotice that in Example 2, the rows that have changes are the rows that have the number 4 in a specific pattern, but row 5 also has 4s but no changes.\n\nRow 5: [4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4] so it has 4s at col0,1,3,5,6,8,10,11,13,15,16 so many 4s, but no changes.\n\nWhereas row 2: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] so 4s at col3,8,13, and they are changed.\n\nSo perhaps the change happens only if the row has a certain number of 4s or something.\n\nBut in Example 1, the rows have different number of 4s.\n\nLet's list the row indices where changes happen in Example 1: changes in row 4,5,6 so rows 4,5,6.\n\nIn Example 3, changes in row 4,5,6,7,8,9 so rows 4 to 9.\n\nSo not consistent row indices.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell to the left is not 4 or the cell to the right is not 4, but that would be all edge cells, but not all change.\n\nI need to consider the possibility that the transformation is based on the presence of 2s nearby.\n\nLet's take another approach. Let's look at the training examples and see the output for each input cell.\n\nFor a cell that is 2, it always remains 2, so no change for 2s.\n\nFor a cell that is 4, it may remain 4 or change to 8.\n\nSo the rule is for cells with value 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition for changing to 8.\n\nFrom Example 1, let's consider the cell (4,8) which is 4 and does not change. What is special about it?\n\nPerhaps it is because it is the first in a run or something.\n\nIn the group, (4,8) is the leftmost in the row for the group, but (5,8) is also leftmost in its row for the group, but it changes.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the cell changes to 8 if it is 4 and the cell below it is 4, but in Example 1, (4,8) has below is 4, but not changed, while (4,9) has below is 4, and changed, so not.\n\nUnless it also requires that the cell below is not changed or something, but that might be circular.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that we change cell to 8 if it is 4 and it is not the only 4 in its column or row, but from Example 2, row 2 col 3 is the only 4 in its row? No, there are three 4s in row 2.\n\nLet's consider the number of 4s in the column.\n\nFor Example 1, column 8: has row4:4, row5:4, row6:2, so two 4s, but row4 col8 not changed, row5 col8 changed.\n\nColumn 9: has row3:4, row4:4, row5:4, row6:4, so four 4s, row4 col9 changed, row5 col9 changed, row6 col9 changed, row3 col9 not in output? Row3 col9 is 4, but in output, it remains 4, from output row3: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,2] so col9:4, not changed.\n\nSo for column 9, row3 col9 not changed, row4 col9 changed, etc.\n\nSo not based on column.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell above is 2, then it changes, but for row4 col9, above is row3 col9=4, not 2, so not.\n\nFor row5 col8, above is row4 col8=4, not 2, so not.\n\nFor row6 col9, above is row5 col9=4, not 2, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's consider the value of the cell above and below.\n\nFor cell (i,j) with value 4, it changes to 8 if the cell above (i-1,j) is 2 and the cell below (i+1,j) is 4, but for row4 col6 in Example 3, above is 2, below is 4, so changes, good.\n\nFor row5 col5 in Example 3, above is row4 col5=4, below is row6 col5=2, so above is 4, below is 2, so not above2 and below4.\n\nBut it changes, so not.\n\nIf above is 4 and below is 2, then change? But for row4 col5, above is 2, below is 4, so it should change, but it does not.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps it changes if above and below are both 4, but for row4 col9 in Example 1, above and below are both 4, so changes, good.\n\nFor row5 col8 in Example 1, above is 4, below is 2, so not both 4, but it changes, so not.\n\nFor row5 col8, above is 4, below is 2, so if above is 4 and below is not 4, then change? But for row4 col8, above is 4, below is 4, so both 4, so it should change, but it does not.\n\nSo for row4 col8, above and below are both 4, but not changed, while for row4 col9, above and below are both 4, and changed.\n\nWhat is the difference between row4 col8 and row4 col9? In row4, col8 and col9 are both 4, but col8 has left is 2, col9 has left is 4, so perhaps the left cell matters.\n\nFor row4 col8, left is 2, so perhaps if left is 2, then not change, but for row5 col8, left is 2, but it changes, so not.\n\nFor row5 col8, left is 2, and it changes, so not.\n\nLet's list the left and right values.\n\nFor row4 col8: left=2, right=4\n\nFor row4 col9: left=4, right=2\n\nFor row5 col8: left=2, right=4\n\nFor row5 col9: left=4, right=4\n\nFor row5 col10: left=4, right=2\n\nFor row6 col9: left=2, right=2\n\nSo no consistent pattern.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell to the left is 2, then it changes, but for row4 col8, left is 2, but not change, so not.\n\nI recall that in some puzzles, the transformation might be to double the value if there is a adjacent cell with value 2 or something.\n\nBut let's try: if there is a adjacent cell with value 2, then double, but for row4 col8, there are adjacent cells with value 2, but not doubled.\n\nNot.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that we change cell to 8 if it is 4 and it is part of a group where the group has more than 2 cells, but from Example 2, row 2 col 3 is a single cell in its group? But it is changed, so not.\n\nIn Example 2, for row 2 col 3, it is not part of a group with other 4s horizontally; horizontally, it is alone, but vertically, it has row3 col3=4, so it is part of a vertical pair, so perhaps groups of size 2 or more, but then why row4 col8 in Example 1 not changed? It is part of a group with many cells.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and it has a cell with value 2 immediately above it, then it changes to 8, but from Example 1, for row4 col9, above is 4, not 2, so not.\n\nFor row5 col8, above is 4, not 2, so not.\n\nFor row6 col9, above is 4, not 2, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's look at Example 3 where changes happen.\n\nIn Example 3, row 4 col 6: above is 2, so changes.\n\nRow 5 col 5: above is 4, so not above 2, but it changes. However, in row 5, col5, above is 4, but perhaps for row 5, the change is because it is in a horizontal run.\n\nBut let's see the cell below.\n\nFor row 5 col 5, below is row6 col5=2, so below is 2.\n\nSo for row 5 col 5, above is 4, below is 2, so if below is 2, then change? But for row 4 col5, below is 4, so not below 2, and not changed.\n\nFor row 5 col 5, below is 2, so changes.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5 col 6, below is row6 col6=4, so below is 4, but it changes, so not below must be 2.\n\nFor row 5 col 6, below is 4, so not below 2.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell below is 2, then it changes, but for row 5 col 6, below is 4, so not, but it changes.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the row or column.\n\nI need to consider that the transformation might be based on the context of the entire grid, but that might be too vague.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is that we identify all cells that are 4 and have a cell with value 2 to their left, and then change them to 8, but from Example 1, row4 col9 has left is 4, not 2, so not, but it changes.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps it's having a cell with value 2 to their right, but row4 col9 has right is 2, so it has right2, so changes, good.\n\nFor row5 col8, right is 4, not 2, so not right2, but it changes.\n\nSo not.\n\nFor row5 col8, left is 2, so if left is 2, then change, but for row4 col8, left is 2, but not change, so not.\n\nWhat is different between row4 col8 and row5 col8? In row4 col8, it is in row4, and in row5 col8, it is in row5.\n\nPerhaps the row index matters.\n\nIn Example 1, changes in row4,5,6.\n\nIn Example 2, changes in row2,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,13.\n\nIn Example 3, changes in row4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo perhaps for row i, if i mod 3 = 1 or something, but row4 mod 3 =1, row5 mod3=2, row6 mod3=0, so not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell at (i-1,j-1) is 2 or something, but let's not guess randomly.\n\nLet's list the changed cells in Example 1 and their coordinates:\n\n(4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9)\n\nNow, let's see the value of the cell at (i-1,j) for each.\n\nFor (4,9): i-1=3,j=9, value 4\n\nFor (5,8): i-1=4,j=8, value 4\n\nFor (5,9): i-1=4,j=9, value 4\n\nFor (5,10): i-1=4,j=10, value 2? Row4 col10=2\n\nFor (6,9): i-1=5,j=9, value 4\n\nSo no pattern.\n\nPerhaps the value of the cell at (i,j-1) or (i,j+1).\n\nFor (4,9): j-1=8, value 4; j+1=10, value 2\n\nFor (5,8): j-1=7, value 2; j+1=9, value 4\n\nFor (5,9): j-1=8, value 4; j+1=10, value 4\n\nFor (5,10): j-1=9, value 4; j+1=11, value 2\n\nFor (6,9): j-1=8, value 2; j+1=10, value 2\n\nSo no consistent value.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell below and to the right is 2 or something.\n\nFor (4,9): below and right: i+1=5,j+1=10, value 4, not 2.\n\nNot.\n\nLet's consider the product or sum of adjacent cells.\n\nI recall that in the output, the value 8 might be the sum of adjacent cells or something, but 4+4=8, so perhaps if the sum of left and right is 8 or something.\n\nFor (4,9): left=4, right=2, sum=6, not 8.\n\nFor (5,8): left=2, right=4, sum=6, not 8.\n\nFor (5,9): left=4, right=4, sum=8, so perhaps if left+right=8, then change to 8, but for (5,9), left and right are both 4, sum=8, so changes, good.\n\nFor (4,9): left=4, right=2, sum=6, not 8, but it changes, so not.\n\nFor (5,8): left=2, right=4, sum=6, not 8, but changes, so not.\n\nFor (5,10): left=4, right=2, sum=6, not 8, but changes, so not.\n\nFor (6,9): left=2, right=2, sum=4, not 8, but changes, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps if left+ right =8 or up+ down =8, but for (4,9), up+ down=4+4=8, so if up+ down=8, then change, good.\n\nFor (5,8): up+ down=4+2=6, not 8, but changes, so not.\n\nFor (5,9): up+ down=4+4=8, so changes, good.\n\nFor (5,10): up+ down=4+2=6, not 8, but changes, so not.\n\nFor (6,9): up+ down=4+2=6, not 8, but changes, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nFor (5,8), up+ down=6, but left+ right=6, so not 8.\n\nBut it changes, so not.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the number of adjacent 4s is odd, but from (4,8), number of adjacent 4s is 2, even, not changed, while (4,9), number is 3, odd, changed, good.\n\nFor (5,8), number of adjacent 4s: left=2, right=4, up=4, down=2, so only right and up are 4, so two adjacent 4s, even, but changed, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nI need to consider that the adjacent cells might include diagonals.\n\nLet's try with including diagonals.\n\nFor (4,8) in Example 1: value 4, adjacent cells including diagonals: there are 8 neighbors.\n\nBut let's not, because it might be too many.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that we change cell to 8 if it is 4 and it is in a position where it is not the top-left of a group or something.\n\nLet's give up on that and look at the test case input.\n\nThe test case input has many 4s and 2s.\n\nPerhaps from the training examples, the pattern is that the changes happen where there are clusters of 4s, but only the cells that have a specific property.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 4, and if there is a cell with value 2 in the same row within distance 2 or something.\n\nBut let's try to see the test case.\n\nPerhaps for the test case, I can assume that the pattern is similar to Example 2, where certain rows have changes.\n\nBut let's list the test case input rows.\n\nThe test case input has 22 rows.\n\nRow 0: [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 1: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 2: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,2]\n\nRow 3: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 4: [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 5: [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,4,2]\n\nRow 6: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 7: [4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4]\n\nRow 8: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 9: [4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 10: [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 11: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 12: [4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\n\nRow 13: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 14: [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 15: [4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2]\n\nRow 16: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 17: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,2]\n\nRow 18: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nRow 19: [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 20: [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2]\n\nRow 21: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2]\n\nNow, notice that some rows have a pattern similar to Example 2. For example, row 1, row 3, row 6, row 8, row 11, row 13, row 16, row 18, row 21 have a pattern where they have value 4 at certain positions, and other rows have more 4s.\n\nIn Example 2, the rows that have changes are the ones that have a specific pattern, like row 2, which has 4s at regular intervals.\n\nIn test case, let's look at row 2: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,2] so many 4s.\n\nBut from Example 2, the rows with changes are not the ones with many 4s, but the ones with few 4s in a pattern.\n\nIn test case, row 1: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col17.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col12, col17.\n\nRow 6: similar to row 3? Row 6: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col12, col17.\n\nRow 8: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col12.\n\nRow 11: similar to row 8? Row 11: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col12.\n\nRow 13: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col17.\n\nRow 16: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col7, col12, col17.\n\nRow 18: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col7, col12, col17.\n\nRow 21: [2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2] so 4s at col2, col12, col17.\n\nSo these rows have 4s at certain columns, and in Example 2, similar rows have changes where the 4s are changed to 8s.\n\nIn Example 2, for row 2, which has 4s at col3,8,13, they are changed to 8s.\n\nIn test case, for rows like row 1, if they have 4s at col2,7,17, perhaps they will be changed to 8s.\n\nBut in Example 2, not all rows have changes; only some rows have changes.\n\nIn Example 2, the rows that have changes are the ones that are not like row 0 or row 5.\n\nIn test case, the rows that are like row 1,3,6,8,11,13,16,18,21 might have changes where the 4s are changed to 8s.\n\nBut for other rows, like row 2, which has many 4s, may not have changes or may have changes only in some cells.\n\nFrom Example 1, changes happen in cells that are in the middle of groups.\n\nFrom Example 3, changes happen in cells that are near 2s or something.\n\nBut for the test case, since it's large, perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell above is 2, then it changes to 8, but let's verify with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, for (4,9), above is 4, not 2, so not, but it changes, so not.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell below is 2, then it changes, but for (4,9), below is 4, not 2, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's consider the vertical alignment.\n\nIn Example 2, for the cells that change, they are in columns where the above and below are 4s or something.\n\nFor example, in row 2 col 3, above is 2, below is 4, so not both.\n\nPerhaps for each cell, if it is 4, and the cell at (i-1,j) is 2, then it changes, but for row 2 col 3 in Example 2, i-1=1,j=3, value 2, so changes, good.\n\nFor row 3 col 3 in Example 2, i-1=2,j=3, value 4, so not 2, but it changes, so not.\n\nFor row 3 col 3, above is 4, not 2, but it changes.\n\nSo not.\n\nFor row 3 col 3, if we consider the cell at (i-2,j) or something.\n\nThis is taking too long. I need to make a decision.\n\nPerhaps from the training examples, the pattern is that the output is the same as input, except that in regions where there are at least three 4s in a 2x2 area, they are changed to 8s, but let's test with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, consider the 2x2 area from row4 col8 to row5 col9: cells (4,8)=4, (4,9)=4, (5,8)=4, (5,9)=4, so four 4s, so they should change, but in output, (4,8) is not changed, so not.\n\nPerhaps only the bottom-right cell changes or something.\n\nFor Example 1, in the group, the cells that change are not (4,8), but others.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that we change cell to 8 if it is 4 and it is not the top-left cell of a connected component of 4s.\n\nIn Example 1, the connected component of 4s includes (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,9). The top-left cell might be (4,8), which is not changed, while others are changed.\n\nIn Example 2, for the 4s in row 2, they are part of vertical components with row 3, so the top-left might be row2 col3, which is changed, so not.\n\nIn Example 2, for row 2 col3, it is the top of the vertical pair, so if we consider each connected component, the top cell might be changed or not.\n\nIn Example 2, for the vertical pair at col3, row2 and row3 have 4s, so top cell is row2 col3, which is changed to 8, and bottom cell row3 col3 is also changed to 8, so both changed.\n\nIn Example 1, for the component, the top-left cell (4,8) is not changed, but other cells are changed.\n\nSo not consistent.\n\nPerhaps for each connected component of 4s, we change all cells except the one with the smallest row index and smallest column index.\n\nIn Example 1, the smallest row index is 4, smallest column index is 8, so (4,8) is not changed, and others are changed, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, for the component at col3, the smallest row index is 2, smallest column index is 3, so (2,3) should not be changed, but in output, it is changed to 8, so not.\n\nIn Example 2, for the component at col3, it is only two cells: (2,3) and (3,3), so smallest row and column is (2,3), which should not be changed, but it is changed, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps for each component, we change the cells that are not the top-right or something.\n\nIn Example 2, for col3, both cells are changed, so no cell is left unchanged.\n\nSo for small components, all cells are changed.\n\nIn Example 1, for the component, one cell is not changed.\n\nSo the rule might be that for a connected component of 4s, if the component has more than 2 cells, then the cell with the smallest row index and smallest column index remains 4, and all other cells change to 8. If the component has 2 or fewer cells, then all cells change to 8.\n\nIn Example 1, the component has 6 cells, so the smallest row and column is (4,8), which remains 4, and others change to 8, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, let's take the component at col3: cells (2,3) and (3,3), so2 cells, so both change to 8, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, at col8: there is a component? Col8 has row2 col8=4, row3 col8=4, row4 col8=4? Let's see Example 2 input.\n\nRow2: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] so col8=4\n\nRow3: [2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2] so col8=4\n\nRow4: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] so col8=4\n\nSo there is a vertical component at col8 from row2 to row4, so three cells: (2,8), (3,8), (4,8). According to the rule, since more than 2 cells, the smallest row and column is (2,8), so it should remain 4, but in output, all these cells are changed to 8? Let's see output for Example 2.\n\nOutput for Example 2: row2: [2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2] so col8=8, so changed.\n\nRow3: [2,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,2,2] so col8=8, changed.\n\nRow4: [2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2] so col8=8, changed.\n\nSo all changed, but according to the rule, (2,8) should remain 4, but it changed to 8, so the rule doesn't hold.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps the smallest row and column is based on the entire component, but in this case, for col8, the component is only vertical, so smallest row is 2, so should remain, but it doesn't.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nI need to consider that in Example 2, the components are larger because there are horizontal connections.\n\nIn Example 2, at col8, row3 has col7=4, col8=4, col9=4, so it is connected horizontally to other cells, so the component includes many cells.\n\nFor example, at row3, there is a horizontal run from col3 to col5? Col3=4, col4=4, col5=4? Row3: [2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2] so col3=4, col4=4, col5=4? col5=2? Let's see: after col4=4, col5=2? No, from the list: indices: col0=2, col1=2, col2=4, col3=4, col4=4, col5=2, col6=2, col7=4, col8=4, col9=4, col10=2, col11=2, col12=4, col13=4, col14=4, col15=2, col16=2\n\nSo col2=4, col3=4, col4=4, so run from col2 to col4? col2=4, col3=4, col4=4, so yes.\n\nThen col7=4, col8=4, col9=4, so another run.\n\nSimilarly col12=4, col13=4, col14=4.\n\nSo there are horizontal runs of three 4s.\n\nAnd vertically, these runs are connected if在同一列有4s, but in different rows, for example, at col2, row2 has col2=2? Row2: [2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,2,2] so col2=2, not 4, so no vertical connection at col2.\n\nAt col3, row2 has col3=4, row3 has col3=4, row4 has col3=4, so vertical connection at col3.\n\nSimilarly at col4, row2 has col4=2, so no vertical at col4.\n\nAt col7, row2 has col7=2, so no vertical.\n\nAt col8, row2 has col8=4, row3 has col8=4, row4 has col8=4, so vertical.\n\nAt col9, row2 has col9=2, so no vertical.\n\nAt col12, row2 has col12=2, so no vertical.\n\nAt col13, row2 has col13=4, row3 has col13=4, row4 has col13=4, so vertical.\n\nSo the components are at col3: row2,3,4 have 4s, but since row2 col3=4, and row3 col3=4, but row3 col3 is part of a horizontal run with col2 and col4, but col2 has no vertical, so the component at col3 includes only the vertical cells? Or including horizontal?\n\nIn terms of connectivity, from row2 col3, it is connected to row3 col3, and row3 col3 is connected to row3 col2 and row3 col4, but row3 col2=4, and row2 col2=2, so no connection to row2, so for row3 col2, it is only connected to row3 col3 and row3 col4, so it is part of a horizontal component in row3.\n\nBut for row2 col3, it is only connected to row3 col3 vertically, so it is a vertical component with row3 col3 and row4 col3.\n\nSimilarly for row3 col3, it is connected to both vertical and horizontal, so the component includes all these cells.\n\nSo for example, the component including row2 col3, row3 col2, col3, col4, row4 col3, etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps for the purpose of this puzzle, the rule is that in the test case, for rows that have a pattern like row 1,3,6,8,11,13,16,18,21, the 4s are changed to 8s, and for other rows, no changes or changes only in specific places.\n\nBut from Example 1, there are changes in rows with many 4s.\n\nLet's look at the test case row 4: [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2] so many 4s, so perhaps some cells will change.\n\nBut I need to predict the output, so I have to make a guess.\n\nPerhaps from the training examples, the pattern is that the cell changes to 8 if it is 4 and the cell to the left is 2 and the cell to the right is 2, but from Example 1, for (6,9), left is 2, right is 2, so changes, good.\n\nFor (4,9), left is 4, right is 2, so not left2 and right2, but changes, so not.\n\nFor (4,9), if left is not 2 and right is 2, then change? But for (5,8), left is 2, right is 4, so left2 and right not2, so change? But for (4,8), left is 2, right is 4, so left2 and right not2, but not change, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nI think I need to accept that for this puzzle, the rule is that in the test case, for the rows that have a specific pattern, the 4s are changed to 8s.\n\nSo for test case, let's take the rows that are like row 1,3,6,8,11,13,16,18,21, and change their 4s to 8s.\n\nFor example, row 1: has 4s at col2,7,17, so change them to 8s.\n\nSimilarly for row 3: has 4s at col2,7,12,17, so change to 8s.\n\nRow 6: has 4s at col2,7,12,17, change to 8s.\n\nRow 8: has 4s at col2,7,12, change to 8s.\n\nRow 11: has 4s at col2,7,12, change to 8s.\n\nRow 13: has 4s at col2,7,17, change to 8s.\n\nRow 16: has 4s at col7,12,17, change to 8s.\n\nRow 18: has 4s at col2,7,12,17, change to 8s.\n\nRow 21: has 4s at col2,12,17, change to 8s.\n\nFor other rows, no changes.\n\nSo for the test case output, these cells will be 8 instead of 4.\n\nBut for Example 1, this doesn't hold, so perhaps for this test case, it might work.\n\nSince the test case is similar to Example 2 in terms of row patterns, perhaps this is the case.\n\nSo for the test case input, I will change the 4s to 8s in the rows that have the pattern of having 4s at certain positions.\n\nSo for the output, I will keep the input as is, but for the rows mentioned, change the 4s to 8s.\n\nSo let's create the output for the test case.\n\nBut to be precise, let's list the rows that have changes: based on Example 2, the rows that have changes are the ones that are not the first few or last few, but in test case, let's see the row indices.\n\nIn Example 2, the rows with changes are from index 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 and 11 to 13, so not continuous.\n\nIn test case, the rows with the pattern are row 1,3,6,8,11,13,16,18,21, so similar.\n\nSo for these rows, change all 4s to 8s.\n\nFor other rows, no change.\n\nSo for the test case output, it will be the same as input, but with those cells changed to 8.\n\nSo for example, row 1: after change, [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for the JSON response, I need to provide the output grid.\n\nSo let's make the output grid.\n\nBut since this is a guess, I'll go with that.\n\nSo for the test case input, the output is the input with 4s changed to 8s in rows 1,3,6,8,11,13,16,18,21.\n\nSo let's create the output array.\n\nFirst, the input array is given.\n\nI will create a copy and modify it.\n\nBut since I need to output the grid, I'll describe it in the JSON.\n\nSo for multiplePredictedOutputs, it is false since only one test case.\n\nSo predictedOutput will be the grid.\n\nSo let's code it mentally.\n\nBut for the reasoning, I'll say that from Example 2, the rows with certain patterns have their 4s changed to 8s, and in test case, similar rows are identified.\n\nSo for the JSON, I'll have:\n\n{\n  \"multiplePredictedOutputs\": false,\n  \"predictedOutput\": [ [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2], [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,2], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2], [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2], [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,4,2], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2], [4,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], [4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2], [4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,4,2], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], [4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2], [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2], [4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2], [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2], [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,2], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2], [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,4,2], [4,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,2], [2,2,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,2] ]\n}\n\nSo this is my prediction.\n\nFor the reasoning, I'll say that from Example 2, the transformation involves changing cells to 8 in rows with a specific pattern of 4s.\n\nSo for the JSON, I'll include this.\n\nSo the final JSON.",
