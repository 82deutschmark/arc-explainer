        "solvingStrategy": "Analyze the transformation from input to output in both training examples. Observe that the output is a 6x6 grid, while the input is 2x2. The pattern involves repeating the input matrix and its transformations (transpose, flip, etc.) in a symmetric way. Specifically, the output is constructed by placing the original matrix, then its horizontal flip, then its vertical flip, then its transpose, and so on, arranged in a 2x2 block of 3x3 matrices. But more precisely, the output is a 6x6 grid formed by tiling and transforming the 2x2 input in a symmetric, mirrored fashion across both axes. The key insight is that the output is generated by creating four 3x3 blocks: the original input repeated, then the input with rows reversed, then columns reversed, then both reversed. But upon closer inspection, the pattern is that the output is constructed by repeating the input matrix three times in each row, but with alternating row order and reversal. However, a better approach is to notice that the output is a 6x6 grid where each 2x2 block is a transformation of the original 2x2 input: (1) original, (2) row-reversed, (3) column-reversed, (4) both reversed. But actually, the pattern is more systematic: the output is formed by taking the input and applying a 2x2 block of transformations: original, flipped vertically, flipped horizontally, and flipped both ways, each repeated in a 3x3 tiling. But the actual pattern is simpler: the output is the input matrix repeated 3 times horizontally, and the rows are also transformed in a symmetric way. After detailed comparison, the pattern is: the output is a 6x6 grid where the first two rows are the input repeated 3 times, the next two rows are the input with rows reversed and repeated 3 times, the next two rows are the input with columns reversed and repeated 3 times, and the last two rows are the input with both rows and columns reversed and repeated 3 times. But this doesn't match. Let's re-express: in Example 1, input [[8,6],[6,4]], output has: row0: [8,6,8,6,8,6] → input repeated 3 times. row1: [6,4,6,4,6,4] → second row repeated 3 times. row2: [6,8,6,8,6,8] → first row reversed? 8,6 → 6,8 → yes. row3: [4,6,4,6,4,6] → second row reversed? 6,4 → 4,6 → yes. row4: [8,6,8,6,8,6] → same as row0. row5: [6,4,6,4,6,4] → same as row1. So the pattern is: rows 0 and 1: original rows repeated 3 times. rows 2 and 3: reversed versions of rows 0 and 1 (but reversed in order: row2 is reverse of row0, row3 is reverse of row1). rows 4 and 5: same as rows 0 and 1. So the full pattern is: repeat the input rows 3 times, then reverse each row and repeat the input rows again, then repeat the original again. But row2 is reverse of row0, row3 is reverse of row1, row4=row0, row5=row1. So the sequence of row transformations is: [original, original, reversed_row0, reversed_row1, original, original]. But that's not consistent. Wait: row0: input_row0 repeated 3 times. row1: input_row1 repeated 3 times. row2: reverse(input_row0) repeated 3 times. row3: reverse(input_row1) repeated 3 times. row4: input_row0 repeated 3 times. row5: input_row1 repeated 3 times. So the row pattern is: [0,1,0_rev,1_rev,0,1]. So the transformation is: take the two input rows, and for the 6 output rows, use: row0: input_row0 repeated 3 times, row1: input_row1 repeated 3 times, row2: reverse(input_row0) repeated 3 times, row3: reverse(input_row1) repeated 3 times, row4: input_row0 repeated 3 times, row5: input_row1 repeated 3 times. This matches Example 1. Now check Example 2: input [[7,9],[4,3]]. row0: [7,9,7,9,7,9] → 7,9 repeated 3 times → input_row0. row1: [4,3,4,3,4,3] → 4,3 repeated 3 times → input_row1. row2: [9,7,9,7,9,7] → reverse of [7,9] is [9,7] → yes. row3: [3,4,3,4,3,4] → reverse of [4,3] is [3,4] → yes. row4: [7,9,7,9,7,9] → same as row0. row5: [4,3,4,3,4,3] → same as row1. So the pattern is confirmed: for a 2x2 input, the output is a 6x6 grid where: - row 0: input_row0 repeated 3 times - row 1: input_row1 repeated 3 times - row 2: reverse(input_row0) repeated 3 times - row 3: reverse(input_row1) repeated 3 times - row 4: input_row0 repeated 3 times - row 5: input_row1 repeated 3 times. This is consistent across both examples. Now apply to test case: input [[3,2],[7,8]]. So input_row0 = [3,2], input_row1 = [7,8]. Then: row0: [3,2,3,2,3,2] (3,2 repeated 3 times) row1: [7,8,7,8,7,8] (7,8 repeated 3 times) row2: reverse([3,2]) = [2,3], repeated 3 times → [2,3,2,3,2,3] row3: reverse([7,8]) = [8,7], repeated 3 times → [8,7,8,7,8,7] row4: [3,2,3,2,3,2] (same as row0) row5: [7,8,7,8,7,8] (same as row1). So the full output is: [[3,2,3,2,3,2],[7,8,7,8,7,8],[2,3,2,3,2,3],[8,7,8,7,8,7],[3,2,3,2,3,2],[7,8,7,8,7,8]]. This matches the pattern.",
