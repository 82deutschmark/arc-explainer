(So the order goes: original, mirrored, original.)",

That gives you 6 cells.\n3. Do the same with the second input row.\n4. Now make two more pairs of rows: for the 2nd pair flip each of the two original rows left-to-right before repeating them; for the 3rd pair go back to the original ordering again.\n5. Stack the three pairs of rows.  You now have a 6Ã—6 answer grid that matches the given solution.",

        "Rows 0-1 and 4-5 look exactly like the input repeated; rows 2-3 look like a mirror image.",

The alternating mirror rows feel like two sides taking turns, suggesting peaceful interaction rather than hostility.",
