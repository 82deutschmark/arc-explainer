        "solvingStrategy": "First, think of each pair of emojis as a number (for example, ðŸ‘¤=3, ðŸ‘½=2). The pattern shows that each pair gets repeated several times. To understand the pattern, imagine writing out the original pairs and then repeating them. Then, add the reversed pairs (swap the order of the emojis in each pair). The pattern alternates between these original and reversed versions, creating a symmetrical sequence. To see this with emojis, switch to thinking of numbers: repeat each pair, then its reverse, and keep doing that to match the pattern.",
