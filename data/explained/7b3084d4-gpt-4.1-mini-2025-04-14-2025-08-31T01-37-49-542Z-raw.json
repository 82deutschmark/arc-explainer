  "solvingStrategy": "The training examples show a pattern where the input grids contain multiple colored regions scattered in a large grid, and the output is a compacted subgrid that extracts and arranges these colored regions into a smaller grid, preserving their relative spatial arrangement and colors. The process involves identifying the bounding box that contains all the colored regions (non-zero values) and cropping the input grid to that bounding box, then possibly rearranging or merging overlapping regions to form a compact output. In the test case, the input grid has several colored regions: a large block of 2's on the left, a block of 3's on the right, a block of 7's below the 2's, and a block of 8's on the right side below the 3's. Following the pattern from training, the output should be a smaller grid that includes these colored blocks arranged similarly, cropped tightly to the minimal bounding rectangle containing all colored pixels. The output grid is formed by extracting rows and columns from the input that cover all colored regions, preserving their relative positions and colors.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Analyzed training examples to identify that outputs are compacted subgrids containing all colored regions from inputs.",
    "Noted that the output grids preserve relative spatial arrangement of colored blocks but crop out empty zero areas.",
    "Observed that the output grids are smaller and contain only the colored regions arranged similarly to input.",
    "Applied this understanding to the test input by finding the minimal bounding rectangle containing all colored pixels.",
    "Extracted this bounding rectangle from the input grid to form the predicted output.",
    "Ensured the relative positions and colors of blocks (2,3,7,8) are preserved in the output."

  "patternDescription": "The transformation extracts the minimal bounding rectangle containing all non-zero colored regions from the input grid and outputs this cropped subgrid preserving the relative spatial arrangement and colors of the regions. Essentially, it crops the input to the smallest rectangle that contains all colored pixels, removing all zero padding around them.",
  "hints": [
    "For each input grid, find the minimal bounding box that contains all non-zero cells and output the subgrid defined by this bounding box.",
    "Identify all colored pixels (non-zero), compute min and max row and column indices, then crop the grid to these indices.",
