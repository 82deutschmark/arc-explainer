      "transformationPattern": "The main transformation involves reversing the order of the digits found in the non-7 entries located in the top-left 3x3 subgrid, effectively rotating or flipping those digits along the diagonal or anti-diagonal. Additionally, some digits in the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid are rearranged in a similar but mirrored manner. The 7s form a border or filler and remain largely unchanged. Non-7 digits inside the core subgrid are reversed or permuted along rows and columns, often swapping positions diagonally to produce the output. The transformations preserve the shape of the 7 borders while rearranging inner digits in a pattern resembling a diagonal flip combined with partial rotation.",
      "reasoningSteps": [
        "Step 1: Analysis of training examples - I observed that the 7s typically form a border or filler elements that stay the same in input and output, so the transformation mainly affects non-7 digits clustered in certain subgrids (mostly top-left 3x3 and bottom-right 3x3 areas).",
        "Step 2: Pattern identification - In example 1, the top-left 3x3 digits appear reversed along the anti-diagonal: input row 0 [9,6,5] becomes output row 0 [5,8,9], with some digits rearranged in a reversed order and similarly for rows 1 and 2. The bottom-right 3x3 block also shows a swapping and rearrangement of digits. Example 2 and 3 confirm this pattern where digits in the top-left 3x3 are reversed or flipped diagonally, and digits in the bottom-right 3x3 are rearranged similarly, while 7s remain unchanged.",
        "Step 3: Application to test case - I identified the non-7 digits in the top-left 3x3 subgrid: positions (1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2) are [2,6,5],[1,7,9],[4,0,9]. Ignoring 7 at (2,1), the pattern suggests reversing these digits along the anti-diagonal or flipping them: the output top-left 3x3 should be a rearrangement of these digits in reverse order diagonally. Similar logic applies to the bottom-right digits (especially in rows 4 and below), rearranging digits in a mirrored fashion. The rest of the grid remains unchanged as 7s.",
        "Therefore, the predicted output swaps and reverses these digits accordingly while keeping the 7s intact."
