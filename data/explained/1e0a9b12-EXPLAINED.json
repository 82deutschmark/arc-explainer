      "patternDescription": "This is a geometric transformation where, in each vertical column of the grid, all the emojis (non-black squares) fall down to the bottom like gravity pulls them, stacking up from the bottom while keeping their original top-to-bottom order. It's like column-by-column translation downward, compressing the symbols to the floor without changing what they are.",
      "solvingStrategy": "Think of the puzzle grid as columns, like tall tubes. In each tube (column), ignore the black squares (‚¨õ) which are empty space. Take all the actual emojis in that column and let them 'fall' to the bottom of the tube, stacking them up starting from the very bottom row upwards. The emoji that was highest up in the column ends up as the highest in the new stack at the bottom. Do this for every column separately. The top parts of the columns become empty (all ‚¨õ). You don't need to think of them as numbers - just treat the emojis as objects that drop down due to gravity in their column. Check the training examples to see how the stacks form, and apply the same to the test.",
      "hints": [
        "Look at each column independently - the transformation happens vertically within columns, not across rows.",
        "Emojis in a column stack at the bottom in the same relative order: the one that was closer to the top stays closer to the top of the new bottom stack.",
        "Empty spaces (‚¨õ) disappear as emojis fall to fill the gaps, but only within their own column."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be demonstrating 'gravity' or 'descent' to show that they (üëΩ) and their ships (üõ∏) are coming down to our planet Earth (üåç), along with symbols of their home (ü™ê) and us humans (üë§). It could be a message about arrival or invasion, like everything is falling towards Earth as a base. This seems potentially hostile, as if they are angry and planning to 'drop in' forcefully, perhaps to take over or warn of a collision between worlds - the stacking of Earth symbols multiple times might imply overwhelming or multiplying the threat.",
