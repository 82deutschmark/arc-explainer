Take the whole square in your hands and spin it one step to the left (¬º of a full turn).  The top now becomes the left side, the right side becomes the top, the bottom becomes the right side, and the left side becomes the bottom.\n3. After that single spin, put the square back down ‚Äì that is the required answer.\n4. Do this for each training example and you see they all match.  When you do it to the test grid (with the üåç tiles) you get the provided correct answer.",
