      "solvingStrategy": "1) Compare inputs and outputs across training: output dimensions are consistently doubled in both axes (2H x 2W). 2) The right half of each output row equals the left half (horizontal duplication of each produced row). 3) For rows containing non-zero colors in the input, the corresponding produced row (left half) preserves those values (simply copy the input row). 4) For rows that are entirely zero in the input, the produced row (left half) is an alternating pattern of 8 and 0 starting with 8 at the first column; this matches examples 3 and 4 and many zero-row occurrences in example 1. 5) Vertically, the set of produced rows for the top half repeats for the bottom half (examples 3 and 4 clearly show vertical repetition; example 1 mostly repeats with occasional deviations, but the dominant consistent rule across examples is repetition). 6) Apply to the test input (6x5): identify non-zero rows (1,4,6) and zero rows (2,3,5). For non-zero rows, keep their patterns; for zero rows, use [8,0,8,0,8] as the left half and duplicate horizontally to get 10 columns. 7) Repeat these six rows to form the bottom half, yielding a 12x10 output. 8) Assemble final matrix by concatenating each left half with itself for horizontal duplication, for all 12 rows.",
      "keySteps": [
        "Observed output width is exactly double input width and right half equals left half in all training examples, indicating horizontal duplication of a generated left-half row.",
        "Observed output height is double input height; in examples 3 and 4, the top half repeats as the bottom half, suggesting vertical repetition of the row sequence.",
        "Non-zero input rows are preserved in output rows (left half) as-is (Example 4 row with 5; Example 3 row with 2; Example 2 rows 1 and 6; Example 1 rows with 4).",
        "Rows that are entirely zeros often become an alternating 8-0 pattern across the row (Examples 3 and 4, and multiple zero rows in Example 1 show [8,0,8,...]).",
        "Apply rule to test: build left-half rows for each input row: non-zero rows copied, zero rows replaced by [8,0,8,0,8].",
        "Duplicate each left-half row to the right to get full width, and repeat the block of rows vertically."
      ],
      "patternDescription": "Transform the grid into a 2x enlargement by rows and columns via duplication, with a specific filler rule for zero rows. For each input row, create a corresponding output row (left half) as follows: if the row contains any non-zero, copy it; if the row is entirely zero, replace it with an alternating pattern of 8 and 0 starting with 8 in the first column. The output row is then duplicated horizontally to form the full row (right half equals left half). After generating one such row per input row for the top half, repeat the same sequence to form the bottom half. The result is a 2H x 2W grid with horizontally duplicated halves and zero rows rendered as 8-0 alternations.",

        "Right half equals left half in all examples, indicating horizontal duplication.",
        "Height is doubled; examples 3 and 4 show clear vertical repetition.",
