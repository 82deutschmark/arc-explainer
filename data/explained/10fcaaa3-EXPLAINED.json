      "reasoningLog": "First, I am considering the task: I need to analyze the training examples and predict the output for the given test case. I must output only valid JSON with the predictedOutput as the first field, and include my reasoning in solvingStrategy.\n\nThe JSON structure should be:\n\n{\n\n\"predictedOutput\": ... ,  // for single test case\n\n\"solvingStrategy\": {\n\n\"keySteps\": [ ... ],\n\n\"patternDescription\": \" ... \",\n\n\"hints\": [ ... ],\n\n\"confidence\": number\n\n}\n\n}\n\nI need to make sure predictedOutput is first.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [[0,0,0],[0,4,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[4,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[8,0,8,8,0,8],[0,4,0,0,4,0],[8,0,8,8,0,8],[0,8,8,0,8,0],[4,0,0,4,0,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8],[0,4,0,0,4,0],[8,0,8,8,0,8],[0,8,8,0,8,0],[4,0,0,4,0,0]]\n\nThe input has 5 rows and 3 columns. Output has 10 rows and 6 columns. So, it's being transformed, possibly expanded.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [[0,0,6,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,6,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8],[8,0,6,0,8,0,6,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0]]\n\nInput: 3 rows, 4 columns. Output: 6 rows, 8 columns.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [[0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0],[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],[0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0],[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nInput: 4 rows, 4 columns. Output: 8 rows, 8 columns.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [[0,0,0,0],[0,5,0,0]]\n\nOutput: [[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],[0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0],[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],[0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]]\n\nInput: 2 rows, 4 columns. Output: 4 rows, 8 columns.\n\nA pattern: In all outputs, there are many 8s. Also, the number 8 seems to be added in a pattern. The input has some non-zero numbers: 4,6,2,5 in the examples.\n\nIn the outputs, the non-zero numbers from input are repeated or placed in specific positions.\n\nLet me find a common transformation.\n\nFirst, notice that the output dimensions are larger. For example 1, input 5x3, output 10x6. 10 is 2*5, 6 is 2*3. Example 2: input 3x4, output 6x8. 6=2*3, 8=2*4. Example 3: input 4x4, output 8x8. 8=2*4, 8=2*4. Example 4: input 2x4, output 4x8. 4=2*2, 8=2*4. So, the output has twice the number of rows and twice the number of columns as input? Not exactly. In example 4, input rows 2, output rows 4, which is 2*2, yes. Columns: input 4, output 8, 2*4, yes. Example 3: input 4x4, output 8x8, yes. Example 2: input 3x4, output 6x8, yes. Example 1: input 5x3, output 10x6, yes, 2*5=10, 2*3=6. So, the grid is scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nBut it's not just scaling; the values are transformed.\n\nNow, looking at the values: in the output, there are patterns of 8s and the original non-zero values.\n\nIn example 1 output: there are rows with 8s and 0s, and rows with the number 4.\n\nSimilarly in others.\n\nNotice that in the output, the non-zero numbers from input seem to be placed in positions that correspond to their original positions but scaled.\n\nAlso, there are additional rows and columns filled with 8s or 0s.\n\nPerhaps it's a kind of tiling or repetition.\n\nAnother thing: in all outputs, there is a pattern where rows alternate or something.\n\nLet me list the outputs.\n\nIn example 1 output: rows: 1: [8,0,8,8,0,8] — this has 8s and 0s\n\n2: [0,4,0,0,4,0] — this has 4s, which is from input row 2 col 2? Input row 2 is [0,4,0], so the 4 is at (2,2) if we index from 1.\n\nBetter to think in terms of indices.\n\nAssume 1-based indexing for simplicity, but in code it's 0-based, but for pattern, we can use relative.\n\nNotice that in the output, the values from input are repeated in a checkerboard or something.\n\nLook at example 3: input has a 2 at (2,2) if rows and cols start from 1.\n\nInput: row1: [0,0,0,0], row2: [0,2,0,0], so 2 at (2,2)\n\nOutput: there are rows with [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — so the 2 appears at col 2 and col 6? Col 6 is 2*3, since input col 2, scaled by 2, col index 2*2=4? Let's think carefully.\n\nPerhaps the input grid is being used to create a larger grid where each cell of input is replaced by a 2x2 block.\n\nIn example 3, input 4x4, output 8x8, so each input cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in output.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, what is the content of each 2x2 block?\n\nIn example 3 output, look at the position of the 2.\n\nInput has 2 at (2,2) — assuming 1-based row and column indices.\n\nIn output, the 2 appears in rows that might correspond to the scaled rows.\n\nOutput row 2: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — so at col 2 and col 6.\n\nCol 2 and col 6: since input col 2, and output has twice columns, so for column j in input, it might affect columns 2j-1 and 2j or something.\n\nLet's find a pattern.\n\nPerhaps for each input cell, the output has a pattern based on the value.\n\nNotice that in all outputs, when the input value is non-zero, it appears in the output, but also there are 8s.\n\nIn example 1, input has 4 at (2,2) and (5,1) — rows: 1:[0,0,0], 2:[0,4,0], 3:[0,0,0], 4:[0,0,0], 5:[4,0,0] so positions (2,2) and (5,1)\n\nIn output, we see 4s at various places.\n\nOutput row 2: [0,4,0,0,4,0] — so at col 2 and col 5? Col 2 and col 5.\n\nSimilarly, row 4: [0,8,8,0,8,0] — no 4, wait.\n\nOutput has multiple rows with 4s: row 2, row 7, row 10? Let's list output rows:\n\n1: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n2: [0,4,0,0,4,0]  // 4 at col 2 and col 5\n\n3: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n4: [0,8,8,0,8,0]  // no 4\n\n5: [4,0,0,4,0,0]  // 4 at col 1 and col 4? Col 1:4, col 4:4\n\n6: [8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\n7: [0,4,0,0,4,0]  // same as row 2\n\n8: [8,0,8,8,0,8]\n\n9: [0,8,8,0,8,0]\n\n10: [4,0,0,4,0,0]  // same as row 5\n\nSo the 4s appear in rows that correspond to the input rows where 4 is present, but scaled.\n\nInput row 2 has 4 at col 2, so in output, for row 2*2=4? But output row 2 has 4, not row 4.\n\nPerhaps it's not direct scaling.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is created by repeating the input pattern with some overlay.\n\nNotice that in all examples, the output has a background of 8s in a grid pattern, and the non-zero values are placed on it.\n\nBut the 8s are not always present; there are 0s too.\n\nLet's look at the pattern of 8s.\n\nIn example 3 output: row 1: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] — alternating 8 and 0\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — not alternating\n\nRow 3: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] — alternating\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] — all 0\n\nRow 5: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] — alternating\n\nRow 6: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — similar to row 2\n\nRow 7: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] — alternating\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] — all 0\n\nSo the rows with alternating 8 and 0 are odd-numbered rows? Row 1,3,5,7 are odd, and they have [8,0,8,0,...] which is pattern starting with 8.\n\nBut row 1,3,5,7 have the same pattern: for columns, it seems every odd column has 8, even has 0? Row 1: col1:8, col2:0, col3:8, col4:0, col5:8, col6:0, col7:8, col8:0 — yes, so for these rows, odd columns are 8, even columns are 0.\n\nBut not all rows have this; row 2,4,6,8 are different.\n\nRow 2: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — not alternating 8 and 0.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 all 0, row 6 similar to row 2, row 8 all 0.\n\nNow, the input has a 2 at (2,2), and in output, it appears at row 2 col 2 and row 6 col 6? Row 2 col 2 is 2, row 6 col 6 is 2.\n\nRow 6 col 6: since input row 2, col 2, and output has twice rows, so row 4 and row 8 should correspond to input row 2? But row 4 is all 0, row 8 all 0, but row 2 and row 6 have the 2s.\n\nOutput rows: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nInput rows: 1,2,3,4\n\nPerhaps each input row is mapped to two output rows: one with the pattern, and one with the values or something.\n\nLet's think about the scaling.\n\nSince output has twice the rows and twice the columns, each input cell (i,j) corresponds to a 2x2 block in output at positions (2i-1,2j-1), (2i-1,2j), (2i,2j-1), (2i,2j) or something.\n\nIn example 3, input (2,2) has value 2.\n\nIn output, the 2 appears at (2,2) and (6,6)? Row 2 col 2 is 2, row 6 col 6 is 2.\n\nRow 6 is 2*3, but input row 2, so if output row k corresponds to input row ceil(k/2) or something.\n\nLet's define input rows as r from 1 to R, cols c from 1 to C.\n\nOutput rows from 1 to 2R, cols from 1 to 2C.\n\nFor each input cell (r,c), it influences the output.\n\nIn example 3, input (2,2)=2, and in output, at (2,2)=2 and (6,2)? No, (6,6)=2.\n\nRow 6 col 6.\n\nRow 6 is 2*3, col 6 is 2*3, but input (2,2), so perhaps (2r,2c) for the value.\n\nIn output, (2,2) has 2, and (6,6) has 2. 2*1=2, 2*1=2 for (2,2), but input r=2,c=2, so (2*2,2*2)=(4,4), but (4,4) is 0 in output, not 2.\n\nOutput row 4 col 4 is 0, from [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] row 4.\n\nNot (4,4).\n\nPerhaps it's (2r-1,2c-1) or something.\n\nLet's list the positions where non-zero values appear in output compared to input.\n\nIn example 3, input (2,2)=2, output has 2 at (2,2) and (6,6).\n\n(2,2) = (2*1,2*1) but input index 2, not 1.\n\nPerhaps for input (r,c), the value appears at output (2r,2c) and also somewhere else.\n\nIn example 3, (2,2) input, output (2,2) and (6,6). 6 is 2*3, but r=2, not 3.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is divided into blocks, and the value is placed at the center or something.\n\nNotice that in all examples, the non-zero values from input are placed in the output at positions that are even rows and even columns or something.\n\nIn example 3 output, 2 appears at row 2 col 2 and row 6 col 6, both even row even column.\n\nSimilarly, in example 4, input has 5 at (2,2) — input row2 [0,5,0,0], so (2,2)=5\n\nOutput: row2: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0] so at col2 and col6, both even columns, row2 even row.\n\nRow2 is even, col2 and col6 even.\n\nIn example 2, input has 6 at (1,3) and (3,2) — input row1 [0,0,6,0] so (1,3)=6, row3 [0,6,0,0] so (3,2)=6\n\nOutput: row1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] so at col3 and col7? Col3:6, col7:6, both odd columns? Col3 odd, col7 odd.\n\nRow1 odd row, col3 and col7 odd columns.\n\nAlso output row3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] — at col2 and col6? Col2:6, col6:6, both even columns.\n\nRow3 odd row? Row3 is odd, but col2 and col6 even.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nOutput row3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] so values at col2 and col6, which are even, but row3 is odd.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,2) input, which is row3 col2, value 6, and in output, it appears at row3 col2=6 and row3 col6=6? But col6 is not directly related.\n\nPerhaps for each input cell, the value is placed at the corresponding scaled position and also repeated horizontally or vertically.\n\nLet's look at the pattern of 8s.\n\nIn all outputs, there is a grid of 8s that seems to be on the odd rows and odd columns or something.\n\nFrom example 3, rows 1,3,5,7 have pattern where odd columns are 8, even columns are 0.\n\nBut not always; in example 1, row1: [8,0,8,8,0,8] — col1:8, col2:0, col3:8, col4:8, col5:0, col6:8 — so not alternating; col4 is 8, not 0.\n\nIn example 1, the pattern is different.\n\nPerhaps the 8s are placed based on the input values or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is created by first creating a base grid of 8s and 0s in a pattern, and then overlaying the input values at specific positions.\n\nBut the base grid might depend on the input size.\n\nLet's find a common rule.\n\nNotice that in all training examples, the output has a number of rows that is twice the input rows, and twice the input columns, as we said.\n\nNow, for the values, the non-zero input values are placed in the output at positions that are multiples of the input dimensions or something.\n\nIn example 3, input 4x4, output 8x8, and 2 appears at (2,2) and (6,6). 2 and 6 are both even, and 2 mod 4 =2, 6 mod 4=2, so perhaps the row index mod input rows, but 2 mod 4=2, 6 mod 4=2, and for column, 2 mod 4=2, 6 mod 4=2, so the value is placed at output rows where row mod R = r, and col mod C = c, for input (r,c), but with some offset.\n\nIn example 3, R=4, C=4, for input (2,2), value 2, placed at output rows where row mod 4 =2, and col mod 4=2, but output has rows 1 to 8, so row mod 4=2 are rows 2 and 6, col mod 4=2 are cols 2 and 6, so at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6). But in output, at (2,2)=2, (6,6)=2, but (2,6)=0 and (6,2)=0 in output row2 col6 is 0, row6 col2 is 0 from output: row2 [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] so col6 is 2, not 0? Row2: index col1 to col8: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] so col2:2, col6:2, so at (2,2) and (2,6) for row2, and for row6, [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] same, so at (6,2) and (6,6)? Row6: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] so col2:2, col6:2, so (6,2)=2 and (6,6)=2.\n\nIn output, for input (2,2), it appears at all positions where row mod 4 =2 and col mod 4=2, which are (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6). But in the output, at (2,2)=2, (2,6)=2? From row2: col6 is 2, yes, (2,6)=2. Similarly (6,2)=2, (6,6)=2. But in the output list, for example 3, output row2: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] so col2:2, col6:2, so (2,2)=2, (2,6)=2. Row6: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] so (6,2)=2, (6,6)=2. But earlier I thought only (2,2) and (6,6), but it's all four positions.\n\nIn the output, there are also other values, but for the non-zero, it seems that for each input cell (r,c) with value v, in output, at all positions where row index mod R = r and col index mod C = c, but since output has 2R rows and 2C columns, the mod is with R and C, so for row index i from 1 to 2R, i mod R can be 1 to R or 0, but since indices start from 1, perhaps i mod R, with mod 1-based.\n\nIn programming, mod usually 0-based, but here indices might be 1-based for pattern.\n\nAssume 1-based indices for simplicity.\n\nFor output row i, col j, where i from 1 to 2R, j from 1 to 2C.\n\nThen, for each input cell (r,c) with value v, it sets output[i,j] = v if i mod R = r and j mod C = c, but mod might not be exact.\n\nIn example 3, R=4, C=4.\n\nFor input (2,2)=2, then output[i,j] should be 2 if i mod 4 = 2 and j mod 4 = 2.\n\ni from 1 to 8, i mod 4: 1->1, 2->2, 3->3, 4->0, but 0 should be 4? Perhaps we need to adjust mod to be 1-based.\n\nDefine the row index in output: let the row number correspond to input row ceil(i/2) or something.\n\nPerhaps for output cell (i,j), it is determined by the input cell at row ceil(i/2), col ceil(j/2), but then the value might be different.\n\nIn example 3, for output (2,2), ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, but input (1,1)=0, not 2.\n\nNot that.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output has a pattern where the values from input are placed at the even row and even column positions of the scaled grid.\n\nIn example 3, output rows: even rows are 2,4,6,8.\n\nRow2: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — so at even columns? Col2 and col6 are even.\n\nRow4: all 0\n\nRow6: similar to row2, [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] — col2 and col6 even\n\nRow8: all 0\n\nSo for even rows, there are values at even columns.\n\nBut not all even rows have values; row4 and row8 have no values, but they are all 0.\n\nIn input, row4 has no non-zero, so perhaps only if the input row has non-zero, but row2 has non-zero, so output even rows corresponding to input rows with non-zero have the values.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nLet's list the input rows and output even rows.\n\nIn example 3, input rows: 1: all 0, 2: has 2, 3: all 0, 4: all 0\n\nOutput even rows: 2,4,6,8\n\nOutput row2 corresponds to input row? Since output has twice rows, row2 might correspond to input row1 or row2.\n\nTypically, output row i corresponds to input row ceil(i/2) or floor((i+1)/2) etc.\n\nAssume output row i corresponds to input row round(i/2) or something.\n\nFor i=2, round(2/2)=1, but input row1 all 0, but output row2 has values, not matching.\n\ni=2, ceil(i/2)=1, floor(i/2)=1, not 2.\n\nPerhaps for even i, it corresponds to input row i/2.\n\ni=2, i/2=1, input row1 all 0, but output row2 has values from input row2? Inconsistency.\n\nLook at the values: in output row2, there is value 2, which is from input row2 col2.\n\nSimilarly, in output row6, value 2, which might correspond to input row3 or something, but input row3 all 0, not 2.\n\nOutput row6 has value 2, which is from input row2.\n\nPerhaps the value is placed at output rows that are multiples or something.\n\nFrom the mod idea earlier.\n\nIn example 3, for input (2,2)=2, it appears at output where row mod 4 =2 and col mod 4=2.\n\nRow mod 4 =2: rows 2,6\n\nCol mod 4=2: cols 2,6\n\nSo at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6)\n\nAnd in output, at those positions, it is 2, and other cells are 0 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, for other input cells that are 0, they don't affect, but the 8s are added.\n\nNow, what about the 8s? In example 3 output, there are rows with alternating 8 and 0, like row1,3,5,7: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] so for these rows, at odd columns, 8, even columns, 0.\n\nBut row1,3,5,7 are odd rows, and they have this pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in example 4, output row1: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] same pattern, row3: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] same.\n\nIn example 4, input 2x4, output 4x8, rows 1 and 3 have the alternating pattern, rows 2 and 4 have the values or 0.\n\nIn example 4, output row2: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0] so values at col2 and col6, both even.\n\nRow4: [0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0] same.\n\nAnd the alternating pattern rows are row1 and row3.\n\nNow, for the alternating pattern, it seems that for odd rows in output, if the row number is odd, then for each column, if the column number is odd, set to 8, else set to 0, but only if no value from input is placed, but in example 3, row1 has [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] and no input value conflict because input values are placed at even rows and even columns or something.\n\nIn example 3, input values are only at even rows and even columns, so no overlap with odd rows where 8s are.\n\nSimilarly in other examples.\n\nIn example 2, output row1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] which has values at col3 and col7, both odd, and row1 is odd, so there is overlap, but the values overwrite the 8s or something.\n\nIn output row1, it has 6 at col3 and col7, but if it were alternating, col3 should be 8, col7 should be 8, but it's 6, so the input values overwrite the base pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in row3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] so at col2,6 should be 0 if alternating, but it's 6, so overwritten.\n\nSo the transformation seems to be:\n\nFirst, create a base grid of size 2R x 2C.\n\nFor each cell in output, if the row index i is odd, and column index j is odd, set output[i][j] = 8, else if i odd and j even, set to 0, but wait no.\n\nFrom the pattern, for odd rows, it seems that output[i][j] = 8 if j is odd, 0 if j is even, for i odd.\n\nBut in example 2, output row1 is odd, but [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] so at j=3, it's 6 not 8, j=7, 6 not 8, so the input values overwrite this.\n\nSimilarly, for even rows, in example 3, output even rows have values or 0, but not the alternating pattern.\n\nFor even rows, the base might be all 0, and then input values are placed.\n\nBut in example 3, row4 and row8 are all 0, which is fine, but row2 and row6 have values.\n\nSo perhaps the base grid is: for all i,j, if i is odd, then if j is odd, set to 8, else set to 0. If i is even, set to 0 for all j.\n\nThen, for each input cell (r,c) with value v (v != 0), set output[i][j] = v for all i,j such that i mod R = r and j mod C = c, with mod 1-based.\n\nSince output has 2R rows, i from 1 to 2R, i mod R can be 1 to R or 0, but 0 should be R for 1-based.\n\nDefine mod' such that for index k, mod'(k, M) = ((k-1) mod M) + 1, so it cycles from 1 to M.\n\nFor output row i, let r' = ((i-1) mod R) + 1\n\nSimilarly for column j, c' = ((j-1) mod C) + 1\n\nThen, for each output cell (i,j), if there is an input cell at (r', c') with value v != 0, then output[i][j] = v, else, if i is odd, then if j is odd, output[i][j] = 8, else 0, and if i is even, output[i][j] = 0.\n\nBut in the cases where input v is 0, it might not affect, but since v=0, it would set to 0, which might overwrite the 8, but in the base, for odd i and odd j, it's 8, but if input v=0, it would set to 0, but in the output, for example, in places where input is 0, the 8 should remain.\n\nIn example 3, for output (1,1), i=1 odd, j=1 odd, base should be 8, and input r' = ((1-1) mod 4) +1 = (0 mod 4)+1 = 0+1=1, c'=1, input (1,1)=0, so if we set output to input value 0, it would be 0, but in actual output, it is 8, so contradiction.\n\nSo not that.\n\nPerhaps only if input v != 0, it overwrites, else keep the base.\n\nBut in the base, for odd i and odd j, it's 8, and if input v=0, it should not change, so output[i][j] should be 8, but if we set based on input, it would be 0 if v=0, which is wrong.\n\nSo the input value only affects when v != 0.\n\nLet's formalize.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that:\n\n- The output grid has dimensions 2R x 2C, where R and C are input rows and columns.\n\n- There is a background pattern: for rows with odd index i, output[i][j] = 8 if j is odd, 0 if j is even.\n\n- For rows with even index i, output[i][j] = 0 for all j, initially.\n\n- Then, for each input cell (r,c) with value v != 0, it sets output[i][j] = v for all i,j such that the row index i satisfies that the \"group\" or something.\n\nFrom earlier, in example 3, for input (2,2)=2, it sets output at i where i mod R =2, but with 1-based mod.\n\ni from 1 to 8, R=4, i mod 4: 1->1, 2->2, 3->3, 4->0, 5->1, 6->2, 7->3, 8->0. But 0 should be 4 for 1-based.\n\nSo define for output row i, the corresponding input row is ((i-1) mod R) + 1\n\nSimilarly for column, ((j-1) mod C) + 1\n\nThen, for each output cell (i,j), let r = ((i-1) mod R) + 1, c = ((j-1) mod C) + 1\n\nThen, if the input value at (r,c) is not 0, then output[i][j] = input[r][c]\n\nElse, if i is odd, then if j is odd, output[i][j] = 8, else 0\n\nIf i is even, output[i][j] = 0\n\nBut in example 3, for i=1,j=1, r = ((1-1) mod 4)+1 = (0 mod 4)+1 = 1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, so since input is 0, and i=1 odd, j=1 odd, so output[1][1]=8, which matches actual output.\n\nFor i=1,j=2, r=1,c=2, input[1][2]=0, i odd, j even, so output[1][2]=0, matches.\n\nFor i=2,j=2, r = ((2-1) mod 4)+1 = (1 mod 4)+1 = 1+1=2, c=2, input[2][2]=2 !=0, so output[2][2]=2, matches.\n\nFor i=2,j=6, j=6, c = ((6-1) mod 4)+1 = (5 mod 4)+1 = 1+1=2, input[2][2]=2, so output[2][6]=2, matches actual output row2 col6=2.\n\nSimilarly for i=6,j=2, r = ((6-1) mod 4)+1 = (5 mod 4)+1 = 1+1=2, c=2, input[2][2]=2, so output[6][2]=2, matches row6 col2=2.\n\nNow for the 8s, when no input value, it works.\n\nIn example 2, let's verify.\n\nExample 2 input: [[0,0,6,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,6,0,0]] so R=3, C=4\n\nOutput: 6x8\n\nFirst, base: for odd i, if j odd, 8, else 0; for even i, 0.\n\nThen for each output cell, if input[((i-1) mod 3)+1][((j-1) mod 4)+1] !=0, set to that value.\n\nNow, output row1: i=1 odd, so base would be for j odd 8, j even 0, but overwritten by input values.\n\nr for i=1: ((1-1) mod 3)+1 = (0 mod 3)+1 = 0+1=1\n\nc for j: ((j-1) mod 4)+1\n\nInput row1: [0,0,6,0]\n\nSo for output row1, j=1: c= ((1-1) mod 4)+1=1, input[1][1]=0, so not overwritten, base: i odd j odd, so 8? But actual output row1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] so at j=1, it is 0, not 8. Contradiction.\n\nActual output row1 has 0 at j=1, but according to this, it should be 8 because input is 0 and i odd j odd.\n\nBut in actual, it's 0. So something wrong.\n\nPerhaps the base pattern is only applied if no input value, but for i=1,j=1, input is 0, so it should be base, which is 8 for odd i odd j, but actual is 0.\n\nIn example 2 output row1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0] so at j=1, it is 0, j=2,0, j=3,6, etc.\n\nBut j=1 and j=2 are 0, which would be base for j even 0, j odd 8, but j=1 odd, should be 8, but is 0.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nPerhaps the base pattern is different.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s are only in certain cells, and the input values are placed, and the rest are 0.\n\nFrom example 2, output has rows with all 8s: row2 and row5 are [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8] and row4 is [8,0,6,0,8,0,6,0] which has 8s and 6s.\n\nLet's list output for example 2:\n\nRow1: [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0]\n\nRow2: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]  // all 8s\n\nRow3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8]\n\nRow4: [8,0,6,0,8,0,6,0]\n\nRow5: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]  // all 8s\n\nRow6: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0]\n\nSo the all-8 rows are row2 and row5, which are even rows? Row2 even, row5 odd? Row5 is odd, 5 odd, but all 8s.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nRow2 and row5 are both multiple of something? 2 and 5, not multiple.\n\nPerhaps the all-8 rows are when the row index is multiple of R or something. R=3, multiples of 3 are row3 and row6, but row3 is not all 8s, row6 is not all 8s.\n\nRow3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] not all 8s.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is created by repeating the input pattern with a specific overlay.\n\nLet's look at the input values.\n\nIn example 2, input has 6 at (1,3) and (3,2)\n\nIn output, the 6 appears at various places.\n\nFrom output, at row1 col3=6, row1 col7=6, row3 col2=6, row3 col6=6, row4 col3=6, row4 col7=6, row6 col2=6, row6 col6=6? Row6: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0] so col2=6, col6=6.\n\nSo for input (1,3)=6, it appears at col3 and col7 for some rows, col3 and col7 are both odd columns.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2)=6, it appears at col2 and col6 for some rows, col2 and col6 even columns.\n\nNow, the rows where it appears: for (1,3), it appears in row1, row3, row4? Row1 has at col3 and col7, row3 has at col2 and col6? No, row3 has 6 at col2 and col6, which is for (3,2), not (1,3).\n\nLet's list the positions for each input cell.\n\nFor input (1,3)=6, in output, it appears at (1,3)=6, (1,7)=6, (4,3)=6, (4,7)=6? Row4: [8,0,6,0,8,0,6,0] so col3=6, col7=6, yes.\n\nAlso in row6? Row6: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0] so col2=6, col6=6, which is for (3,2), not (1,3).\n\nSo for (1,3), it appears at row1 col3, row1 col7, row4 col3, row4 col7.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2)=6, it appears at row3 col2=6, row3 col6=6, row6 col2=6, row6 col6=6.\n\nNow, the rows: for (1,3), rows 1 and 4; for (3,2), rows 3 and 6.\n\nNow, row1 and row4: 1 and 4, which are 1 and 4, and R=3, so not obvious.\n\nPerhaps the rows where the value appears are the rows that are congruent to the input row modulo R, but with offset.\n\nFor input row r, the value appears in output rows where i ≡ r mod R, but i from 1 to 2R, so for R=3, i mod 3 = r.\n\nFor r=1, i mod 3 =1: i=1,4,7 but output has 6 rows, i=1,4 (since 7>6)\n\nSimilarly for r=3, i mod 3 =3 or 0, so i=3,6\n\nYes! i mod R = r, but for r=3, i mod 3 =0, which should be 3 for 1-based, so i mod R = r if r !=0, else R.\n\nIn general, for output row i, the row index mod R should equal the input row index.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nIn example 2, for input (1,3)=6, r=1, c=3, so output[i][j] =6 if i mod 3 =1 and j mod 4 =3\n\ni mod 3 =1: i=1,4 (since i=1 to 6, i=1,4; i=7 not in range)\n\nj mod 4 =3: j=3,7 (j=1 to 8, j=3,7)\n\nSo at (1,3), (1,7), (4,3), (4,7), which matches output.\n\nSimilarly for input (3,2)=6, r=3, c=2, so i mod 3 =3 or 0, so i=3,6 (i mod 3=3 for i=3, i mod 3=0 for i=6? But 0 should be 3, so i mod 3 =3 for i=3,6? i=3 mod 3=0, i=6 mod 3=0, so for mod, i mod R =0 when i multiple of R, but for 1-based, we want i mod R = r, so for r=3, i mod 3 should be 0, which we can interpret as 3.\n\nSimilarly for columns, j mod C = c.\n\nFor c=2, j mod 4=2: j=2,6\n\nSo at i=3,6 and j=2,6, so (3,2), (3,6), (6,2), (6,6)\n\nIn output, row3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] so at j=2 and j=6, both 6, yes.\n\nRow6: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0] so j=2 and j=6, both 6, yes.\n\nNow for the 8s and 0s.\n\nIn the output, there are cells with 8s.\n\nIn example 2, row2: all 8s, row5: all 8s, and other cells have 0 or values.\n\nRow2 and row5 are i=2 and i=5.\n\ni mod R: for R=3, i=2 mod 3=2, i=5 mod 3=2, so both i mod 3=2.\n\nSimilarly, in example 3, there are rows with alternating 8 and 0 or all 0.\n\nIn example 3, output row1: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] which is for i=1 odd, and perhaps base pattern.\n\nBut from the mod pattern, for output cells where there is no input value (i.e., for (i,j) such that there is no input cell with r = i mod R, c = j mod C and v !=0), then we set a base value.\n\nBut what is the base value?\n\nIn example 2, for i=2, which is i mod 3=2, and for all j, if there is no input value, but in this case, for i=2, and any j, the input row r = i mod 3 =2, but input row2 is [0,0,0,0], all 0, so for all j, input value is 0, so no overwriting, so we set base value.\n\nBut what is base value? In output, for i=2, all cells are 8, so base value is 8 for this row.\n\nSimilarly for i=5, i mod 3=2, same, all 8.\n\nFor other rows, like i=1, i mod 3=1, and for j, if j mod 4 =3, there is input value 6, so overwrite to 6, else, what? In output, for i=1, j=1,2,4,5,6,8 are 0, but j=1 odd, should it be 8? No, in actual, it's 0.\n\nPerhaps the base value depends on the row and column parity only when no input value.\n\nBut in example 2, for i=1, which is odd, and for j odd, if no input value, it should be 8, but in actual, for j=1, no input value (since for j=1, c= j mod 4=1, input[1][1]=0), so it should be 8, but actual is 0, so contradiction.\n\nUnless the base value is not based on parity alone.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s are placed in cells where the row index and column index are both odd, but only if no input value is present.\n\nIn example 2, for i=1,j=1, both odd, no input value (input[1][1]=0), so it should be 8, but actual is 0, so not.\n\nLet's list all cells in example 2 output where 8 appears.\n\n8 appears in row2 all cells, row5 all cells, and in row3 at j=4,8? Row3: [0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8] so j=4=8, j=8=8\n\nRow4: [8,0,6,0,8,0,6,0] so j=1=8, j=5=8, etc.\n\nSo 8s are at various positions.\n\nPerhaps the 8s are placed in cells where the row index i is multiple of something or based on the input.\n\nNotice that in all examples, the number 8 appears in the output, and it might be related to the input values or the grid size.\n\nLet's think about the test case.\n\nPerhaps for the test case, I need to find the pattern from training examples.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is the input grid repeated twice in both directions, but with values replaced or something.\n\nIn example 3, input is 4x4, output is 8x8, so it could be the input tiled 2x2 times.\n\nBut the values are not identical; for example, the 2 appears multiple times.\n\nIn the tiling, each instance of the input might have the values, but in the output, the values are only where the input has non-zero, but scaled.\n\nIn example 3, if we tile the input, for position (i,j) in output, it corresponds to input cell (ceil(i/2), ceil(j/2)), but then the value should be the same, but in output, for (2,2) it is 2, but for (4,4) it is 0, while input (2,2)=2, so not direct tiling.\n\nPerhaps the input is used to create a pattern where the non-zero values are placed at intervals.\n\nFrom the mod idea, it seems that for each input cell (r,c) with value v, it sets output[i][j] = v for all i,j such that i ≡ r mod R and j ≡ c mod C, where mod is with the input dimensions, and for output, i from 1 to 2R, j from 1 to 2C, so i mod R can be 1 to R or 0, but for i mod R =0, it should be R, similarly for j.\n\nThen, for cells where no input value is set (i.e., for (i,j) where the corresponding input cell has value 0), then we set output[i][j] based on some rule.\n\nIn example 3, for cells where no input value, like (1,1), i=1, j=1, i mod 4=1, j mod 4=1, input[1][1]=0, so no value set, then what? In output, it is 8, so perhaps for such cells, if i is odd and j is odd, set to 8, else set to 0.\n\nIn example 3, for (1,1), i=1 odd, j=1 odd, set to 8, good.\n\nFor (1,2), i=1 odd, j=2 even, set to 0, good.\n\nFor (2,1), i=2 even, j=1 odd, but i mod 4=2, j mod 4=1, input[2][1]=0, so no value, then for i even, set to 0, which matches output row2 col1=0.\n\nFor (2,2), i mod 4=2, j mod 4=2, input[2][2]=2, so set to 2, good.\n\nFor (4,4), i=4 even, j=4 even, i mod 4=0 which is 4, j mod 4=0 which is 4, input[4][4]=0, so no value, then for i even, set to 0, which matches output row4 col4=0.\n\nNow for example 2, let's try this.\n\nExample 2, input R=3, C=4\n\nFor output cell (i,j), let r = i mod 3, but i mod 3 can be 0,1,2. For 1-based, when i mod 3 =0, it corresponds to input row 3.\n\nSimilarly for c, j mod 4, when 0, input col 4.\n\nSo for (i,j), if input[ (i-1) mod R + 1 ][ (j-1) mod C + 1 ] !=0, then output[i][j] = that value.\n\nElse, if i is odd and j is odd, output[i][j] = 8\n\nElse, output[i][j] = 0\n\nNow for example 2, output row1 i=1 odd\n\nj=1: c = ((1-1) mod 4)+1 =1, input[1][1]=0, so not set, i odd j odd, so output[1][1]=8? But actual is 0, contradiction.\n\nSo not working for example 2.\n\nPerhaps for the else case, it depends on whether the row or column has input values or something.\n\nIn example 2, for i=1, which is odd, but in output, row1 has no 8s, all 0 or values.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, let's look.\n\nExample 1 input: [[0,0,0],[0,4,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[4,0,0]] so R=5, C=3\n\nOutput: 10x6\n\nNow, for output cell (i,j), if input[ ((i-1) mod 5)+1 ][ ((j-1) mod 3)+1 ] !=0, set to that value.\n\nElse, if i odd and j odd, set to 8, else 0.\n\nBut in output, for i=1,j=1: i=1 odd, j=1 odd, input[1][1]=0, so should be 8, but actual output row1 col1=8, good.\n\ni=1,j=2: i odd, j even, input[1][2]=0, so should be 0, actual is 0, good.\n\ni=1,j=3: i odd, j odd, input[1][3]=0, so should be 8, actual is 8, good.\n\ni=1,j=4: j=4, c = ((4-1) mod 3)+1 = (3 mod 3)+1 =0+1=1, input[1][1]=0, so not set, i odd, j=4 even, so should be 0, actual is 8? Output row1: [8,0,8,8,0,8] so col4=8, but according to this, it should be 0 because j even. Contradiction.\n\nSo not working.\n\nFor j=4, c = ((4-1) mod 3)+1 = (3 mod 3)+1 =0+1=1, input[1][1]=0, so no value, i=1 odd, j=4 even, so should be 0, but actual is 8.\n\nSo the base pattern is not simply based on i and j parity; it must be that for some cells, even if no input value, it is 8 even when j even.\n\nIn example 1 output, for i=1, col4=8, col6=8, both even, so for odd i, sometimes j even has 8.\n\nSimilarly in other examples.\n\nPerhaps the base pattern is that for all cells, output[i][j] = 8 if both i and j are odd, but then for i=1,j=4, both not odd, so should be 0, but is 8, so not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the input grid convolved with a kernel or something.\n\nLet's list the training examples and find a common pattern.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that the output is created by taking the input, and for each row, we add a row below it with a pattern, and for each column, we add a column to the right with a pattern.\n\nBut from example 1, input has 5 rows, output has 10 rows, so perhaps each input row is followed by a new row.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nIn example 1, input row1: [0,0,0], output has row1: [8,0,8,8,0,8] which is different.\n\nPerhaps for each input row, we create two output rows: one is the input row with values placed, and another is a row of 8s and 0s.\n\nBut let's look at the values.\n\nIn example 3, input row2: [0,2,0,0], and in output, the values from row2 appear in row2 and row6, which are even rows.\n\nRow2 output: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] so it has the value at col2 and col6, which correspond to input col2.\n\nSimilarly, for input col2, the value appears at col2 and col6 in output.\n\nSo perhaps for each input cell (r,c) with value v, it is placed at output row 2r-1 and 2r, and col 2c-1 and 2c or something.\n\nIn example 3, for input (2,2)=2, output row 2*2-1=3? But output row2 has it, not row3.\n\nOutput row2 is even, so perhaps at row 2r and col 2c.\n\n2*2=4, but output row2, not row4.\n\n output row2 has it, so perhaps at row r and col c for the first occurrence, but scaled.\n\nLet's assume that the output row i corresponds to the input row for i odd, and for i even, it's a new row.\n\nBut for i even, it has values or 0.\n\nFrom example 3, output row2: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] which has values from input row2, but at col2 and col6.\n\nSimilarly, output row4: all 0, which corresponds to input row4 all 0.\n\nOutput row6: [0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0] same as row2, which might correspond to input row2 again.\n\nSo perhaps the output rows are: for each input row r, we have two output rows: one is the input row with values placed at even columns or something, and another is a row with 8s or 0s.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the output is the input grid repeated twice, but with the non-zero values only appearing in the positions where the row and column indices are even in the output, but scaled.\n\nFor example, in output, for input (r,c), the value appears at (2r,2c) and also at (2r,2c-1) or something.\n\nIn example 3, for (2,2), it appears at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6), as I thought earlier.\n\nAnd for the base, the cells that are not set by input values are set to 8 if the row and column are both odd, else 0.\n\nBut in example 2, for (1,1), i=1,j=1, both odd, input[1][1]=0, so should be 8, but actual is 0, so not.\n\nUnless for example 2, since input has values, it's different.\n\nPerhaps for the else case, it is always 0, but then how do 8s appear?\n\nIn example 2, there are rows with all 8s, so must be that for some cells, it is 8.\n\nLet's list the cells where 8 appears in example 2 output.\n\n8 appears at: row2 all cells, row5 all cells, and in row3 at j=4,8; row4 at j=1,5; etc.\n\nNow, row2: i=2, which is even, and all cells have 8, so for i=2, all j, output[i][j]=8, similarly for i=5.\n\ni=2 and i=5, both i mod 3=2, as I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, in example 3, there are no all-8 rows, but there are rows with alternating 8 and 0, like row1,3,5,7, which are i mod 4=1,3,1,3? i=1 mod4=1, i=3 mod4=3, i=5 mod4=1, i=7 mod4=3.\n\nSo for i mod R =1 or 3, and for those rows, if no input value, then if j odd, 8, else 0.\n\nIn example 3, for i=1, which is i mod4=1, and for j, if no input value, then if j odd, 8, else 0.\n\nFor j=1, no input value ( input[1][1]=0), j odd, so 8, good.\n\nFor j=2, no input value, j even, so 0, good.\n\nFor j=3, no input value, j odd, so 8, good.\n\nBut for j=4, no input value, j even, so should be 0, but in actual output, it is 0? Output row1: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0] so col4=0, yes.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow for i mod R =2 or 0, which is 2 or 4 for R=4, i=2,4,6,8.\n\nFor i=2, i mod4=2, and for j, if no input value, then what? In example 3, for i=2, and j, if no input value, but for i=2, the input row r = i mod4=2, input[2][c] for some c, but for each j, c = j mod4.\n\nFor example, for i=2,j=1, c = j mod4=1, input[2][1]=0, so no input value, then what? In output, it is 0, so perhaps for i mod R =2 or 0, if no input value, output[i][j]=0.\n\nSimilarly for i=4, all 0, i=6, for j=1, c=1, input[2][1]=0, so no value, output[6][1]=0, good.\n\nBut for i=2,j=2, there is input value, so overwrite to 2.\n\nNow for example 2, R=3.\n\nFor output cell (i,j), let r = i mod 3, with mod 1-based: when i mod 3=0, r=3, when i mod 3=1, r=1, when i mod 3=2, r=2.\n\nSimilarly for c = j mod 4, with j mod 4=0, c=4, etc.\n\nIf input[r][c] !=0, then output[i][j] = input[r][c]\n\nElse, if i mod R =1 or i mod R =3 (for R=3, i mod 3=1 or 3), and if j odd, then output[i][j] = 8, else 0\n\nIf i mod R =2, then output[i][j] = 0\n\nBut for i mod R =2, in example 2, i mod 3=2 for i=2,5, and for those, output[i][j] should be 0, but in actual, for i=2, all cells are 8, not 0. Contradiction.\n\nSo for i mod R =2, it is not always 0; in example 2, it is all 8s.\n\nPerhaps the else case depends on whether the input row has non-zero values or something.\n\nIn example 2, for i mod 3=2, which is input row2, and input row2 is all 0, so for i mod R =2 and if input row2 is all 0, then output[i][j] = 8 for all j? But in example 3, for i mod4=2, which is input row2, and input row2 has value 2, so for i mod4=2, output[i][j] is not all 8s; it has values where applicable.\n\nIn example 3, for i=2, which is i mod4=2, output[i][j] has values at j where c=2, and 0 elsewhere.\n\nSo perhaps for the else case, when no input value, the output is based on the row mod R.\n\nBut for i mod R =2, in example 2, since input row2 is all 0, output[i][j] = 8 for all j when i mod3=2.\n\nIn example 3, for i mod4=2, input row2 has value, so for cells with no input value, output[i][j] = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for i mod4=4 or 0, which is input row4, all 0, so output[i][j] = 0 for all j when i mod4=0.\n\nIn example 3, i=4,8, output all 0.\n\nFor i mod4=1 or 3, output[i][j] = 8 if j odd, else 0, when no input value.\n\nNow for example 2, R=3.\n\nFor i mod3=1 or 3, which is input row1 or row3, and for those, when no input value, output[i][j] = 8 if j odd, else 0.\n\nFor i mod3=2, which is input row2, and since input row2 is all 0, output[i][j] = 8 for all j.\n\nLet's verify for example 2.\n\nFirst, for i=1, i mod3=1, input row1.\n\nFor each j, c = j mod4.\n\nIf input[1][c] !=0, then output[i][j] = input[1][c]\n\nElse, since i mod3=1, output[i][j] = 8 if j odd, else 0.\n\nNow for j=1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, so not set, i mod3=1, j odd, so output[1][1]=8? But actual is 0, contradiction.\n\nStill not working.\n\nFor j=1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, so according to this, output[1][1]=8 because j odd, but actual is 0.\n\nSo must be that for some reason, it is not 8.\n\nPerhaps the \" else \" case is only if the input row is all 0, but for i=1, input row1 is not all 0; it has value at c=3.\n\nSo for i=1, when no input value, it should be 0, not 8.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the base value is 8 only for cells where the row and column are both odd, and only if the corresponding input cell is 0, but in example 2, for i=1,j=1, both odd, input[1][1]=0, so should be 8, but is 0, so not.\n\nI need to accept that for example 2, it is an exception, or perhaps I misread the output.\n\nLet's look back at the training examples.\n\nIn example 2 output: [[0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[0,6,0,8,0,6,0,8],[8,0,6,0,8,0,6,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0]]\n\nSo for row1, it is [0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0], so at j=1, it is 0, not 8.\n\nBut in other examples, for odd i and odd j, it is 8 when no input value.\n\nIn example 2, for i=1,j=1, why is it 0?\n\nPerhaps because for j=1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, and for some reason, it is 0.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s are only in cells where the row index i is odd and the column index j is odd, but only if the input value at that position is 0, but in example 2, for i=1,j=1, input[1][1]=0, so it should be 8, but is 0, so not.\n\nPerhaps the background 8s are only in the all-8 rows, and for other rows, it is 0 when no input value.\n\nIn example 2, the all-8 rows are i=2 and i=5, which are i mod3=2.\n\nFor i=1,3,4,6, there are no 8s except where values are.\n\nIn row3, there are 8s at j=4 and j=8.\n\nSo for i=3, which is i mod3=0, input row3, and for j=4, c=4, input[3][4]=0, so no input value, and output[3][4]=8.\n\nSimilarly for j=8, c=0 which is 4, input[3][4]=0, output[3][8]=8.\n\nSo for i=3, when no input value, output[i][j] = 8 if j mod4=0 or something.\n\nj=4, j mod4=0, which is c=4, input[3][4]=0, so output=8.\n\nSimilarly for i=1, for j=7, c=3, input[1][3]=6, so output=6, not 8.\n\nFor j=1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, output=0, not 8.\n\nSo for i=1, when no input value, output=0, not 8.\n\nSo the base value depends on i mod R.\n\nFor i mod R =1, when no input value, output=0\n\nFor i mod R =2, when no input value, output=8 for all j\n\nFor i mod R =0, when no input value, output=8 if j mod C =0, else 0\n\nBut for i mod R =0, in example 2, R=3, i mod3=0 for i=3,6\n\nFor i=3, when no input value, output=8 if j mod4=0, else 0.\n\nFor j=4, j mod4=0, output=8, good.\n\nFor j=8, j mod4=0, output=8, good.\n\nFor j=1, j mod4=1, output=0, good.\n\nFor i=6, i mod3=0, when no input value, output=8 if j mod4=0, else 0.\n\nIn output, for i=6, [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0] so for j=2,6, there is input value, so overwrite to 6, for other j, no input value, so for j=1,3,5,7, output should be 0 if j mod4 !=0, which is true, and for j=4,8, j mod4=0, so should be 8, but in actual, for j=4, it is 0, not 8. Contradiction.\n\nOutput row6: [0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0] so j=4=0, j=8=0, but according to this, it should be 8 for j=4 and j=8.\n\nSo not.\n\nFor i=6, i mod3=0, which is input row3, and input row3 has value at c=2, so for cells where no input value, output=0, not 8.\n\nIn example 2, for i=6, j=4, c=4, input[3][4]=0, so no input value, and output[6][4]=0, so for i mod3=0, when no input value, output=0.\n\nSimilarly for i=3, when no input value, output=8 for some j, but for i=3, j=4, output=8, but for i=6, j=4, output=0, so inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps it depends on the specific i.\n\nI need to give up and look for the test case.\n\nPerhaps for the test case, I can find the pattern from the examples.\n\nLet's list the input and output for each example.\n\nIn example 1, input has non-zero at (2,2)=4 and (5,1)=4\n\nIn output, the 4 appears at positions where row mod 5 =2 and col mod 3 =2 for (2,2), and row mod 5 =5 and col mod 3 =1 for (5,1).\n\nSimilarly for other examples.\n\nAnd for the background, it seems that for rows where i mod R =1,3,5, etc., it has the pattern with 8s, but it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps the output is always twice the size, and the non-zero values are placed at (2r-1,2c-1), (2r-1,2c), (2r,2c-1), (2r,2c) or something.\n\nIn example 3, for input (2,2)=2, it appears at (2,2), (2,6), (6,2), (6,6), which is (2*1,2*1), (2*1,2*3), (2*3,2*1), (2*3,2*3) but 2*1=2, 2*3=6, so for input (r,c), it appears at (2r,2c) and also at (2r,2c) for other scales.\n\n2r and 2c for r=2,c=2, 4 and 4, but (4,4) is 0, not 2.\n\nIn output, (4,4) is 0, so not.\n\nPerhaps it appears at (2r-1,2c-1), (2r-1,2c), (2r,2c-1), (2r,2c) but for r=2,c=2, (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4) but in output, (3,3) is 8, not 2, (3,4)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, so not.\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the input grid with each cell replaced by a 2x2 block, and the content of the block depends on the value.\n\nIf value is 0, the 2x2 block is [8,0;0,0] or something.\n\nIf value is v, the 2x2 block is [v,0;0,v] or something.\n\nIn example 3, for input (2,2)=2, so block should be [2,0;0,2], but in output, at the position, it should be placed.\n\nInput is 4x4, output 8x8, so for input cell (1,1)=0, so block [8,0;0,0] or something.\n\nFor (1,1), output should be rows 1-2, cols 1-2.\n\nOutput row1 col1=8, row1 col2=0, row2 col1=0, row2 col2=2? No, row2 col2=2 from other cell.\n\nNot.\n\nFor input (1,1)=0, the block might be [8,0;0,0], so output[1][1]=8, output[1][2]=0, output[2][1]=0, output[2][2]=0, but in actual output, output[2][2]=2 from (2,2), so overlap.\n\nSo not independent.\n\nPerhaps the blocks are overlapped or something.\n\nI think I need to accept that for the purpose of this task, I should use the mod method with the background based on row mod R.\n\nFor the test case, let's assume that for output cell (i,j), let r = ((i-1) mod R) + 1, c = ((j-1) mod C) + 1\n\nIf input[r][c] !=0, then output[i][j] = input[r][c]\n\nElse, if i is odd and j is odd, output[i][j] = 8, else 0\n\nAnd for example 2, it doesn't work, but perhaps for the test case, it will work, or I need to find from the test case.\n\nLet's look at the test case.\n\nTest case input: [[0,3,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,3,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,0,0]] so R=6, C=5\n\nNon-zero values at (1,2)=3, (4,4)=3, (6,2)=3\n\nNow, output should be 2R x 2C = 12x10\n\nFor each output cell (i,j), r = ((i-1) mod 6) + 1, c = ((j-1) mod 5) + 1\n\nIf input[r][c] !=0, then output[i][j] = input[r][c]\n\nElse, if i is odd and j is odd, output[i][j] = 8, else 0\n\nNow, for example, at i=1,j=1, r=1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, so not set, i odd j odd, so output[1][1]=8\n\nSimilarly, for i=1,j=2, r=1, c=2, input[1][2]=3 !=0, so output[1][2]=3\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThen for the background, it will have 8s where i odd and j odd and no input value.\n\nNow, for the training examples, this works for example 1,3,4 but not for example 2, but perhaps example 2 is an outlier, or I misread example 2.\n\nIn example 2, for i=1,j=1, r=1, c=1, input[1][1]=0, so should be 8, but in the given output, it is 0, so maybe there is a mistake in my reasoning or in the example.\n\nPerhaps for cells where the input value is 0, it is always 0, and the 8s are only in specific rows.\n\nBut for the test case, I'll go with this.\n\nSo for test case, R=6, C=5\n\nOutput dimensions 12x10\n\nNow, for each i from 1 to 12, j from 1 to 10, compute r = ((i-1) mod 6) + 1, c = ((j-1) mod 5) + 1\n\nIf input[r][c] !=0, output[i][j] = input[r][c]\n\nElse, if i odd and j odd, output[i][j] = 8, else 0\n\nNow, since the input has values only at (1,2), (4,4), (6,2), all value 3.\n\nSo for example, when r=1,c=2, input=3, so when i mod6=1 and j mod5=2, output=3\n\ni mod6=1: i=1,7\n\nj mod5=2: j=2,7\n\nSo at (1,2), (1,7), (7,2), (7,7) output=3\n\nSimilarly for r=4,c=4, i mod6=4: i=4,10\n\nj mod5=4: j=4,9\n\nSo at (4,4), (4,9), (10,4), (10,9) output=3\n\nFor r=6,c=2, i mod6=0 which is 6: i=6,12\n\nj mod5=2: j=2,7\n\nSo at (6,2), (6,7), (12,2), (12,7) output=3\n\nFor other cells, if i odd and j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nNow, for the output grid, I need to create it.\n\nBut since it's a list of lists, I need to write the predicted output.\n\nAlso, for the JSON, I need to have predictedOutput as first field.\n\nSo let's compute the output grid.\n\nFirst, list all i,j where output=3: as above.\n\nAlso, for background, when no input value, and i odd and j odd, output=8.\n\nNow, i from 1 to 12, j from 1 to 10.\n\nFirst, find all (i,j) where output=3:\n\nFrom above: (1,2), (1,7), (7,2), (7,7), (4,4), (4,9), (10,4), (10,9), (6,2), (6,7), (12,2), (12,7)\n\nNow, for other cells, if i odd and j odd, output=8, else output=0.\n\nNow, i odd: 1,3,5,7,9,11\n\nj odd: 1,3,5,7,9\n\nSo for example, at (1,1), i=1 odd, j=1 odd, and not in the list above, so output=8\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), i=1 odd, j=3 odd, not in list, so output=8\n\n(1,5), output=8\n\n(1,7), but (1,7) is in list, output=3, so overwrite.\n\nSimilarly, (1,9), output=8\n\n(1,10), j=10 even, so output=0\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to create the full grid.\n\nSince it's large, I might need to write a program, but since I'm to output JSON, I should describe the output.\n\nBut for the response, I need to provide the predicted output grid.\n\nSo let's try to compute it row by row.\n\nFirst, row i=1: j from 1 to 10\n\nj=1: i=1 odd, j=1 odd, not in list, so output=8\n\nj=2: in list, output=3\n\nj=3: i=1 odd, j=3 odd, not in list, so output=8\n\nj=4: not in list, i=1 odd, j=4 even, so output=0\n\nj=5: i=1 odd, j=5 odd, not in list, output=8\n\nj=6: not in list, i=1 odd, j=6 even, output=0\n\nj=7: in list, output=3\n\nj=8: not in list, i=1 odd, j=8 even, output=0\n\nj=9: i=1 odd, j=9 odd, not in list, output=8\n\nj=10: not in list, i=1 odd, j=10 even, output=0\n\nSo row1: [8,3,8,0,8,0,3,0,8,0]\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut let's make sure about the mod calculation.\n\nr = ((i-1) mod R) + 1, for R=6, i=1, (0 mod6)+1=1, i=2, (1 mod6)+1=2, ..., i=6, (5 mod6)+1=6, i=7, (6 mod6)+1=0+1=1, etc.\n\nSimilarly for c.\n\nAnd input[r][c] for r=1 to 6, c=1 to 5.\n\nInput row1: [0,3,0,0,0] so input[1][2]=3\n\nInput row2: [0,0,0,0,0] all 0\n\nInput row3: [0,0,0,0,0] all 0\n\nInput row4: [0,0,0,3,0] so input[4][4]=3\n\nInput row5: [0,0,0,0,0] all 0\n\nInput row6: [0,3,0,0,0] so input[6][2]=3\n\nNow for output, when input[r][c]!=0, output[i][j] = input[r][c]\n\nElse, if i odd and j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nNow for row i=1: as above, [8,3,8,0,8,0,3,0,8,0]\n\nNow row i=2: i=2 even, so for background, if no input value, output=0 since i even.\n\nBut need to check for input values.\n\nr for i=2: ((2-1) mod6)+1 = (1 mod6)+1=1+1=2\n\nSo for each j, c = ((j-1) mod5)+1\n\nIf input[2][c] !=0, but input[2][c] is all 0 for all c, so no input value for any j when i=2.\n\nSince i=2 even, output[i][j] = 0 for all j.\n\nSo row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSimilarly for i=3: i=3 odd, r= ((3-1) mod6)+1 = (2 mod6)+1=2+1=3\n\nInput[3][c] all 0 for all c, so no input value.\n\nSo for each j, if j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nj from 1 to 10, odd j: 1,3,5,7,9 so output=8 for those, else 0.\n\nSo row3: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nNow i=4: i=4 even, r= ((4-1) mod6)+1 = (3 mod6)+1=3+1=4\n\nNow input[4][c] has value at c=4, input[4][4]=3\n\nSo for each j, c = ((j-1) mod5)+1\n\nIf c=4, then input[4][4]=3, so output[i][j] =3 when c=4\n\nc=4 when j mod5=4, i.e., j=4,9\n\nSo for j=4 and j=9, output=3\n\nFor other j, input[4][c]=0, so no input value, and since i=4 even, output=0\n\nSo row4: for j=1 to 10, when j=4, output=3, j=9, output=3, else 0.\n\nSo [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\nNow i=5: i=5 odd, r= ((5-1) mod6)+1 = (4 mod6)+1=4+1=5\n\nInput[5][c] all 0 for all c, so no input value.\n\nSo for each j, if j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nSo row5: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\nNow i=6: i=6 even, r= ((6-1) mod6)+1 = (5 mod6)+1=5+1=6\n\nInput[6][c] has value at c=2, input[6][2]=3\n\nSo for each j, c = ((j-1) mod5)+1\n\nIf c=2, then input[6][2]=3, so output=3 when c=2\n\nc=2 when j mod5=2, i.e., j=2,7\n\nSo for j=2 and j=7, output=3\n\nFor other j, input[6][c]=0, so no input value, and i=6 even, output=0\n\nSo row6: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nNow i=7: i=7 odd, r= ((7-1) mod6)+1 = (6 mod6)+1=0+1=1\n\nInput[1][c] has value at c=2, input[1][2]=3\n\nSo for each j, c = ((j-1) mod5)+1\n\nIf c=2, then output=3 when c=2, i.e., j=2,7\n\nAlso, for other j, if no input value, and i=7 odd, so if j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nBut when c=2, output=3, which may overwrite.\n\nSo for j=2, c=2, output=3\n\nj=7, c=2, output=3\n\nFor other j, no input value, so if j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nj odd: 1,3,5,7,9 but j=7 is already 3, so for j=1,3,5,9, output=8 if odd, but j=1,3,5,9 are odd, so output=8\n\nj even: 4,6,8,10, output=0\n\nBut j=7 is handled.\n\nSo row7: j=1: output=8 (i odd, j odd, no input)\n\nj=2: output=3 (input)\n\nj=3: output=8 (i odd, j odd, no input)\n\nj=4: output=0 (i odd, j even, no input)\n\nj=5: output=8 (i odd, j odd, no input)\n\nj=6: output=0 (i odd, j even, no input)\n\nj=7: output=3 (input)\n\nj=8: output=0 (i odd, j even, no input)\n\nj=9: output=8 (i odd, j odd, no input)\n\nj=10: output=0 (i odd, j even, no input)\n\nSo [8,3,8,0,8,0,3,0,8,0]\n\nSimilarly for i=8: i=8 even, r= ((8-1) mod6)+1 = (7 mod6)+1=1+1=2\n\nInput[2][c] all 0, so no input value, and i even, so output=0 for all j.\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\ni=9: i=9 odd, r= ((9-1) mod6)+1 = (8 mod6)+1=2+1=3\n\nInput[3][c] all 0, so no input value, so if j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nRow9: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\ni=10: i=10 even, r= ((10-1) mod6)+1 = (9 mod6)+1=3+1=4\n\nInput[4][c] has value at c=4, so output=3 when j=4,9 (since c=4 when j=4,9)\n\nOtherwise output=0\n\nRow10: [0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0]\n\ni=11: i=11 odd, r= ((11-1) mod6)+1 = (10 mod6)+1=4+1=5\n\nInput[5][c] all 0, so no input value, so if j odd, output=8, else 0.\n\nRow11: [8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0]\n\ni=12: i=12 even, r= ((12-1) mod6)+1 = (11 mod6)+1=5+1=6\n\nInput[6][c] has value at c=2, so output=3 when j=2,7\n\nOtherwise output=0\n\nRow12: [0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]\n\nNow, the full output grid is the list of these rows.\n\nSo predicted output: \n\n[\n\n[8,3,8,0,8,0,3,0,8,0],  // row1\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],    // row2\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],    // row3\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0],    // row4\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],    // row5\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0],    // row6\n\n[8,3,8,0,8,0,3,0,8,0],    // row7\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],    // row8\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],    // row9\n\n[0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0],    // row10\n\n[8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0],    // row11\n\n[0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]     // row12\n\n]\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output this.\n\nAlso, for the solvingStrategy, I need to describe the reasoning.\n\nAlthough it didn't work for example 2, perhaps for this test case, it works.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\nSo predictedOutput is the above list.\n\nNow for JSON.",
