  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves identifying and preserving repeating horizontal patterns while removing non-repetitive rows. The output grid retains only the rows that form consistent horizontal patterns, typically involving specific color/number sequences that repeat across the width of the grid. Non-pattern rows, especially those with isolated elements or breaks in the pattern, are replaced with rows of zeros. The key is to identify the core repeating units and replicate them in the output while eliminating noise or irregularities.",
  "keySteps": [
    "1. Observe the input grids and their corresponding outputs in the training examples.",
    "2. Notice that the output grids are significantly simplified, often containing only horizontal bands of repeating patterns.",
    "3. Identify that rows in the input which form consistent horizontal patterns (like solid color bands or repeating sequences) are preserved in the output.",
    "4. Recognize that rows which are irregular, contain isolated elements, or break the horizontal flow are replaced with rows of zeros in the output.",
    "5. Apply this rule to the test case: scan each row of the input grid.",
    "6. For each row, determine if it forms a repeating horizontal pattern similar to those seen in the training outputs.",
    "7. If a row matches the pattern (e.g., a sequence of numbers that repeats or forms a solid band), copy it to the output.",
    "8. If a row does not match (e.g., contains isolated elements, breaks, or irregularities), replace it with a row of zeros.",
    "9. Construct the output grid by applying this logic to all rows of the input grid."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation rule is to filter the input grid, preserving only rows that exhibit a consistent horizontal pattern. These patterns are typically characterized by repeating sequences of numbers or solid color bands that span the row. Rows that do not conform to these patterns, such as those with isolated elements, breaks, or irregular structures, are replaced with rows of zeros. The output grid is thus a simplified version of the input, containing only the most prominent and repetitive horizontal structures.",
  "hints": [
    "Pseudocode 1 (Best): 1. Initialize an empty output grid of the same size as the input. 2. For each row in the input grid: a. Check if the row consists of a repeating pattern or solid band. b. If yes, copy the row to the output grid. c. If no, fill the corresponding row in the output grid with zeros. 3. Return the output grid.",
    "Pseudocode 2 (Math): Let R be a row vector. Define a function IsPattern(R) that returns 1 if R is a repeating pattern or solid band, and 0 otherwise. The output grid O is constructed such that O[i] = R[i] * IsPattern(R[i]) + 0 * (1 - IsPattern(R[i])).",
