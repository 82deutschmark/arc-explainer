  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed all training examples to identify the pattern of extracting contiguous regions of non-zero values and arranging them in a grid based on their spatial relationships. In each example, the output grid is composed of the non-zero regions from the input, arranged in the order they appear from top-left to bottom-right, with each region maintaining its original shape but being placed adjacent to others in the output. The test case input contains three main regions: a large '2' region in the top-left, a '3' region in the top-right, a '7' region in the middle-left, and an '8' region in the bottom-right. The output should be a grid that combines these regions in spatial order.",
  "keySteps": ["Examined Example 1: Input has regions of 9s (top-left), 7s (top-right), 4s (middle), and 3s (bottom-right). Output arranges these in a 6x6 grid with 9s top-left, 7s top-right, 4s middle-left, and 3s bottom-right.", "Examined Example 2: Input has regions of 7s (top-left), 2s (top-right), 3s (middle-left), and 6s (bottom-right). Output arranges these in a 10x10 grid with 7s top-left, 2s top-right, 3s middle-left, and 6s bottom-right.", "Examined Example 3: Input has regions of 2s (top-left), 6s (top-right), 8s (middle-right), and 7s (bottom-left). Output arranges these in a 4x4 grid with 7s top-left, 8s top-right, 6s bottom-left, and 2s bottom-right.", "Identified pattern: The output grid is formed by taking all contiguous non-zero regions from the input and arranging them in a grid based on their relative positions. The regions are placed in the output such that their spatial relationships (top, bottom, left, right) are preserved.", "Applied to test case: The input has a large region of 2s in the top-left, a region of 3s in the top-right, a region of 7s in the middle-left, and a region of 8s in the bottom-right. The output should be a grid that combines these regions, with 2s top-left, 3s top-right, 7s bottom-left, and 8s bottom-right.", "Determined output size: Based on the sizes of the regions, the output should be 20x21 to accommodate all regions while maintaining their proportions and spatial relationships."],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation involves identifying all contiguous regions of non-zero values in the input grid. These regions are then arranged in the output grid based on their relative spatial positions in the input. Regions that are towards the top-left in the input appear towards the top-left in the output, regions towards the top-right appear towards the top-right, and so on. The output grid size is determined by the combined dimensions of all regions when arranged according to their spatial relationships.",
  "hints": ["Best algorithm: For each non-zero region in the input, extract its bounding box and value. Sort regions by their centroid coordinates (first by row, then by column). Create an output grid that arranges these regions in a layout that preserves their relative spatial positions from the input.", "Math algorithm: Let R be the set of all contiguous regions with non-zero values. For each region r in R, compute its center (mean_row, mean_col). Define output grid rows = max(mean_row) - min(mean_row) + max_height, columns = max(mean_col) - min(mean_col) + max_width.
