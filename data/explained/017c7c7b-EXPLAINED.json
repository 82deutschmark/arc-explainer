      "patternDescription": "The transformation involves replacing all '1's with '2's, keeping '0's unchanged, and extending the pattern into a larger grid by stacking or repeating transformed rows consistent with the input's structure.",
      "hints": "The key insight was observing the consistent replacement of '1' with '2' across examples and the manner of extension, which roughly doubles or repeats the pattern vertically and horizontally.",
