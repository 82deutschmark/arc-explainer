For example, in a 10x3 grid, if rows 1-3 are colored, I replicate them in reverse starting from row 8. \n\nSo, in one test case with rows having 3’s and 5’s followed by zeros, I’ll note the number of colored rows before the first zero and reflect those rows in the bottom half. It’s about mirroring the top block accurately!\n**Constructing mirrored grid output**\n\nI’m analyzing the grid's structure. The first three colored rows are rows 1-3, so the output should reflect this in the top section. Rows 4-7 are zeros, and below that, I have rows 8, 9, and 10 with 5’s and 3’s respectively. I need to replicate the sequence in reverse: for instance, row 3 (5's second) becomes row 10. \n\nThus, the bottom section displays row 8 as 5’s, row 9 as 5’s, and row 10 as 3’s. Overall, I’ll keep a symmetrical approach while crafting the output!",

Remember those rows in the same order you saw them.  3. Beginning with the last grid row and moving upward, write the remembered rows back in reverse order.  (The last remembered row is written first, the first remembered row is written last.)  4. Every row that was already all zeros and is not overwritten stays zero.  The top part therefore remains the same, the middle stays zero, and the bottom becomes a reversed copy of the header block.",
