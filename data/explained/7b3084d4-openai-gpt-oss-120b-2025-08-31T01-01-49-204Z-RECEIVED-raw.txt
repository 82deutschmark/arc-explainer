  "solvingStrategy": "Identified that the task packs each distinct colored component (connected non‑zero region) together without gaps, preserving their original shapes. Components are placed in reading order (top‑most, then left‑most) aligning their top edges. After placing a row of components, the next component starts on the row immediately below the tallest component of the previous row. Applied this packing to the test input, extracting the five components (colors 2,3,7,8,5) and arranging them as described, producing a compact 17×14 grid.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Parsed each training example and observed that non‑zero regions keep their exact shape.",
    "Noted that output grids contain the same colored shapes but shifted to eliminate empty rows/columns between them.",
    "Determined ordering rule: components are placed left‑to‑right in a row, ordered by their original top‑most row, then start a new row after the tallest component of the current row.",
    "Extracted component bounding boxes and patterns from the test input.",
    "Placed component 2 at (0,0), component 3 to its right, component 7 below them, component 8 to the right of 7, and component 5 below 7.",
    "Constructed the final grid row by row."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "For each distinct non‑zero color, keep its exact pixel pattern. Remove all empty rows/columns between components by packing them tightly: components are ordered by the smallest row index of any of their cells, then placed left‑to‑right in the current row until a new row is needed (after the tallest component of that row). The result is a compact grid containing all original shapes with their original colors.",
  "hints": [
    "Pseudo‑code: \ncomponents = findConnectedComponents(input);\nsort components by minRow;\nrowY = 0; rowHeight = 0; colX = 0;\nfor comp in components:\n    if colX + comp.width > maxWidthAllowed: // not needed here\n        rowY += rowHeight; colX = 0; rowHeight = 0;\n    place comp at (rowY, colX);\n    colX += comp.width;\n    rowHeight = max(rowHeight, comp.height);",
    "Math: Let C_i be component i with width w_i and height h_i. Define cumulative width W_k = Σ_{i≤k} w_i for components in same packing row. Row breaks when Σ heights of current row components' max exceeds next component's top index. Output grid size = max over rows of (Σ w_i) by (sum of max heights per row).",
