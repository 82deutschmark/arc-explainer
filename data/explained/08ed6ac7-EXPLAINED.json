For example, if we have columns with the number 5 at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7, the colors assigned could be 2, 3, 1, and 4. Each distinct column encountered when scanning from top to bottom gets its value assigned based on the order encountered. I want to test this with an example to solidify my understanding.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Validating mapping rules**\\n\\nIn row 1, I've got a 5 at col 1 and col 5. When scanning left to right, col 1 is first, so I assign it color 2 since it hasn't been mapped yet, while col 5 already has color 1. Moving on to row 3, col 3 is new, so it gets a 3, and in row 6, col 7 is a new column, receiving a 4. Now, for example 2, I'll implement a scanning rule from rows 0 to 8, assigning numbers to each new column encountered that contains a 5. Each time I find a 5, I'll replace it with the assigned number while keeping non-5 cells unchanged. This transformation will help generate the 9x9 output grid.\"}]",
