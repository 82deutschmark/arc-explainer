  "solvingStrategy": "1. Observe that each training example has a large grid (30x30) with a small pattern in the middle and produces a small output grid. 2. Identify the unique non-zero numbers in each example and their spatial arrangement. 3. Notice that the output seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on the unique patterns. 4. For Example 1, the unique numbers are 1, 2, 4, 5. The output is a 3x6 grid. 5. For Example 2, the unique numbers are 4, 8, 9, 5. The output is a 14x2 grid. 6. For Example 3, the unique numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7. The output is a 16x3 grid. 7. Realize that the output might be related to the connected components or specific arrangements of the unique numbers. 8. Look for repeating patterns or structures in the input that correspond to elements in the output. 9. Notice that in Example 1, there are vertical bars of 1s, 2s, and 4s, and horizontal bars of 5s. The output might represent these structures. 10. In Example 2, there are vertical bars of 4s, 8s, and 9s, and horizontal bars of 5s. The output is a sequence that might represent the vertical structure. 11. In Example 3, there are 3x3 blocks of 2s and 3s, and horizontal bars of 5s and 7s. The output is a sequence of 3x3 blocks. 12. For Test 1, identify the unique numbers: 4, 5, 6. Notice the repeating patterns of 4s and 6s. 13. For Test 2, identify the unique numbers: 2, 3, 5. Notice the repeating patterns of 2s and 3s, and a separate pattern of 5s. 14. Apply the pattern recognition from the training examples to the test cases to generate the outputs.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Analyzed the input and output grids of the training examples to understand the transformation.",
    "Identified unique numbers in each training example and their spatial arrangements.",
    "Recognized that the output is a condensed representation of the input patterns.",
    "Noticed that the output dimensions vary based on the input patterns (e.g., number of unique structures).",
    "Observed that the output often represents connected components or specific arrangements of the unique numbers.",
    "Identified repeating patterns in the inputs and how they map to the outputs.",
    "For Example 1, recognized vertical and horizontal bar structures and their representation in the 3x6 output.",
    "For Example 2, recognized vertical bar structures and their representation in the 14x2 output.",
    "For Example 3, recognized 3x3 block structures and their representation in the 16x3 output.",
    "Applied the learned patterns to Test 1, identifying unique numbers 4, 5, 6 and their repeating structures.",
    "Applied the learned patterns to Test 2, identifying unique numbers 2, 3, 5 and their repeating structures.",
    "Generated the output grids for Test 1 and Test 2 based on the identified patterns."

  "patternDescription": "The transformation involves identifying unique non-zero numbers and their spatial arrangements in the input grid. The output is a condensed representation that captures the essential structural patterns of these unique numbers. The specific arrangement in the output (e.g., dimensions, sequence) depends on the repeating structures and connected components of the unique numbers in the input.",
  "hints": [
    "1. Find unique non-zero numbers. 2. Identify their connected components/structures. 3. Condense these structures into a new grid based on their arrangement.",
    "unique_numbers = set(input_grid) - {0}; structures = find_components(input_grid, unique_numbers); output = condense_structures(structures)",
