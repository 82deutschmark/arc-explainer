For each sub-grid, I need to find the most frequently occurring non-zero digit, with a frequency requirement of at least five. If no digit meets the criteria, I’ll output 0. The transformation essentially simplifies the grid by picking the majority value from each 3x3 block. I'll apply this to a given test input to visualize the concept better. Let's break down those blocks and count the frequencies accurately.\n**Transforming grid blocks**\n\nI'm analyzing each 3x3 block for majority values. In Block A, 4 is the majority, so I output 4. For Block B, since 5 appears only once and there are all zeros, the output is 0. Block C also has 5 appearing once, leading to another output of 0. \n\nBlock D is entirely zeros, so that’s another 0. Block E has all 3s, resulting in 3. Block F has a lone 5, leading to 0. Block G features a 5, also outputting 0. Lastly, Block H has 9 as the majority, outputting 9. Block I is all zeros too. So the final output is [[4,0,0],[0,3,0],[0,9,0]]. I’ll format this in JSON with an explanation.",

      "patternDescription": "The input grid is always a 9x9 array that is conceptually divided into 9 non‐overlapping 3x3 sub‐grids, arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. For each 3x3 sub-grid the transformation selects the dominant nonzero digit if one exists (i.e. the number that appears most frequently when there is a clear majority) and outputs 0 otherwise. In the training examples, many blocks were almost uniformly filled with one number (or almost all zeros) so the resulting output 3x3 grid is formed by taking each block’s majority digit (ignoring the background 0 if no majority nonzero exists).",
      "solvingStrategy": "Step 1: Partition the 9x9 input grid into 9 contiguous 3x3 blocks in row‐major order.\nStep 2: For each 3x3 block, count the frequency of the nonzero digits. If one digit appears predominantly (as seen in the training examples, where the color number filled the block except for an occasional stray), then choose that digit. If no nonzero majority is evident (for example if there is only one nonzero occurrence in an otherwise all-zero block), then output 0 for that block.\nStep 3: Arrange the 9 chosen numbers in a 3x3 output grid corresponding to the positions of the blocks.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n• Top‐left block (rows 0–2, cols 0–2):\n  - Contains: [4,4,4], [5,4,4], [4,4,4].\n  - Frequency: 4 appears 8 times and 5 appears once. Majority digit is 4 → Output = 4.\n• Top‐middle block (rows 0–2, cols 3–5):\n  - Contains: [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,5,0].\n  - Only a single 5 among mostly 0’s → Output = 0.\n• Top‐right block (rows 0–2, cols 6–8):\n  - Contains: [0,5,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0].\n  - Only one occurrence of 5; therefore, output = 0.\n• Middle‐left block (rows 3–5, cols 0–2):\n  - Contains all zeros → Output = 0.\n• Middle block (rows 3–5, cols 3–5):\n  - Contains: [3,3,3], [3,3,3], [3,3,3] → Uniformly 3 → Output = 3.\n• Middle‐right block (rows 3–5, cols 6–8):\n  - Contains: [0,5,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0].\n  - Only one nonzero 5, so output = 0.\n• Bottom‐left block (rows 6–8, cols 0–2):\n  - Contains: [0,0,5], [0,0,0], [0,0,0].\n  - Only one nonzero 5; output = 0.\n• Bottom‐middle block (rows 6–8, cols 3–5):\n  - Contains: [9,9,9], [9,5,9], [9,9,9].\n  - Frequency: 9 appears 8 times and 5 once → Majority is 9 → Output = 9.\n• Bottom‐right block (rows 6–8, cols 6–8):\n  - Contains all zeros → Output = 0.\n\nThus, putting the block outputs in order yields the 3x3 grid:\n[[4, 0, 0],\n [0, 3, 0],\n [0, 9, 0]].",
