      "solvingStrategy": "Think of the puzzle grid as three columns standing tall. Work on one column at a time, starting from the top. For each cell down the column: if it's a ‚¨õ (empty), change it to match whatever is right above it (copy the emoji from above). Do this row by row going down, so changes higher up affect the ones below. Leave non-‚¨õ emojis alone. Do all columns like this. No need to switch to numbers - just treat ‚¨õ as special blanks that get filled by copying from above!",

        "Focus on columns, not rows - the action happens up and down",

In this puzzle, their home planet (ü™ê) and peace (‚ô•) are spreading down to fill empty spaces, but danger (‚òÑÔ∏è) pops up and stays put in the middle. It could mean they're peacefully expanding toward us (Earthlings), but warning of incoming problems - not hostile, but urgent like 'friends coming, but watch out for dangers en route'. No anger here, more like cautious outreach.",
