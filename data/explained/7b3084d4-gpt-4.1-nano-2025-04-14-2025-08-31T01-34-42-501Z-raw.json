  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed the training examples to identify the transformation pattern, which involves isolating the most prominent features (such as the largest contiguous blocks or specific marker values) and then extracting or highlighting these features in the output. The pattern appears to involve segmenting the input grid based on the dominant features and then representing these features in a simplified or consolidated form. For the test input, the pattern suggests focusing on the most frequent or prominent value (here, '2') and creating a uniform grid of this value, indicating a pattern of uniform filling based on the dominant feature.",
