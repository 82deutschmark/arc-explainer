  "solvingStrategy": "We observed that each training example contains hollow rectangular shapes of a single color embedded in a zero background. The task is to identify the first such hollow shape in the test input and reconstruct its full border as an isolated grid (filling in any missing edges). In training1 and training3, that meant finding a partially drawn rectangle and outputting a complete perimeter. In training2, this same reconstruction was implicitly encoded as a sequence of boundary color transitions around multiple copies; for the first test case we approximate this as a chain of adjacency pairs along the vertical stack of hollow shapes.\n\nFor Test1, we scan down the left half of the grid, detect successive hollow rectangles in colors 5,4,6,4,6, and record the boundary transitions between background (0) and each shape, as well as within each shape (shape-to-same-shape). This yields a list of 16 adjacent-color pairs.\n\nFor Test2, we locate the first hollow rectangle of color 3 (top strip at rows 0‚Äì1, cols 12‚Äì16), compute its bounding box (5√ó3), and output the complete perimeter grid with 3s on the border and 0s inside.",

    "Test2 matches single-shape reconstruction: extract first hollow rectangle, build full 3-row√ó5-col border grid."
