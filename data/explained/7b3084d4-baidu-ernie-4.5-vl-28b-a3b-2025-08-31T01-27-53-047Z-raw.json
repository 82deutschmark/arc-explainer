    "solvingStrategy": "Examined each training example to identify patterns. Observed that the output is derived by extracting specific sub-regions from the input grid, transforming them, and placing them into a smaller output grid. The transformation involves selecting regions with distinct values (like 9, 7, 4, 5, 3, 2, 8, 6) and mapping them to output positions based on their relative locations in the input. The output grid size is consistently 6x6 (or 7x7 in one case but reduced via subtraction), indicating a pattern extraction and placement strategy.",
    "keySteps": [
      "Analyzed Example 1: Output is a 6x6 grid derived from specific regions in the 20x20 input. For instance, the 9s in the input are mapped to the top-left 3x3 of the output (values 5,7,7; 7,4,7; 4,4,4).",
      "Analyzed Example 2: Output is 10x10, derived from the input 20x20. The 7s in the input are mapped to the top-left 7x7 of the output (values 5,7,7,7,7,2,2; ...), and other values like 4, 3, 2, 6 are placed accordingly.",
      "Analyzed Example 3: Output is 4x4, derived from the input 20x20. The 7s and 5s are mapped to the top-left 2x2 (5,7; 7,8) and 2x2 below (6,6; 6,2) respectively, with other values like 8, 6, 2 placed.",
      "Identified the transformation: For each test case, the output grid is formed by selecting regions from the input that contain specific values (like 7, 9, 4, 5, 3, 2, 8, 6) and placing them in the output grid in a consistent pattern. The output grid size is determined by the maximum extent of these regions in the input.",
      "Incorrect Approach: Initially considered geometric transformations (rotation, scaling) but the output grid size remained constant (6x6, 10x10, 4x4) across examples, indicating it's not a geometric transformation but a pattern extraction.",
      "Insight: The transformation is a pattern extraction and placement. The output grid is built by taking the most prominent regions (with distinct values) from the input and placing them in the output grid in a fixed layout."

The pattern is consistent across examples, with the output grid having dimensions that match the regions' sizes in the input.",
