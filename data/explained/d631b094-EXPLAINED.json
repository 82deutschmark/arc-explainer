For the first example, I see a 3x3 array turns into a 1x3 row filled with 2's, based on the count of non-zero digits, which are found at specific coordinates. \n\nNext, with the second example, four occurrences of 8 result in a 1x4 row of 8's. In the last example, there are two 1's leading to a 1x2 output row. Maybe it's about identifying the unique nonzero values and their counts!"

It looks like I should output a single row filled with the same non-zero digit for however many times it appears. \n\nFor instance, in the test input with multiple 4's, I counted a total of 5 non-zero entries, which means I should predict an output of [[4,4,4,4,4]]. Now I’ll create the necessary JSON structure with my predicted output and ensure everything follows the required format. Time to finalize that!"
