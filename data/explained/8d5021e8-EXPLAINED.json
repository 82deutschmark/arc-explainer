I'm thinking about how the blocks might look based on Example1 and matching the patterns. The first thought is that all blocks may be identical if the first elements are constant. Example3 has variations, yet for my test, all first elements are the same (3).\n\nI'll need to establish the correct tile configuration. Since a single fixed number seems to yield identical blocks in previous examples, perhaps the key lies in applying a shared structure for these specific cases. I must finalize the appropriate row-wise pattern for my calculations!"
