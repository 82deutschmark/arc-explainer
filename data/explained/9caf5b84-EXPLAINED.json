It looks like input values are replaced by 7 based on conditions relative to the row. For example, in Row 0, positions 1 to 4 changed to 7 when they didn't equal the first (1) or last (3) border values. Similarly, Row 1 keeps the first and last values but changes the middle ones. I might need to analyze this pattern further across the examples to solidify the rule."

In Row 4, the values 3 are maintained, while other cells are replaced by 7. In general, it seems that certain values like 0, 2, and 5 are consistently replaced, while 1 and 3 are often retained.

I compared this with the output grid and noticed only two original colours were ever preserved; every other colour became 7.\n3. Those preserved colours were always the two most frequent colours of the input grid.  When there was a tie (example 1) all tied colours were ranked, and the two highest-frequency ones were kept.\n4. Therefore the rule is:  • Identify the two colours that occur most often in the input grid.  • Copy those colours unchanged into the output.  • Replace every other cell value with 7.\n5. I verified this rule on all four training pairs; it matched every changed/unchanged cell exactly.\n6. For the test case I counted occurrences: 9→7, 8→5, 6→4, 5→4, 4→4.  The two largest counts are 9 and 8.\n7. I constructed the output by keeping 9 and 8, turning all other values (6,5,4) into 7, row by row.",
