    "I observed that connected components of non-zero values were being transformed into single rows or columns, depending on their orientation. For example, in the first training input, the 9s and 7s in the middle were compressed into a single row, while the 4s were transformed into a column.",
    "I also noticed that the compressed components were shifted to the top-left corner of the output grid, leaving the remaining cells as zeros.",
    "For the test case, I applied the same transformation rules. I identified connected components of non-zero values and determined whether they should be compressed into rows or columns. I then shifted these compressed components to the top-left corner, resulting in the predicted outputs."
