  "solvingStrategy": "First, I examined the training examples and noticed that the outputs are always a compacted, cropped version of the colored blocks in the input, with all nonzero blocks grouped together and arranged in a tight rectangle. The color blocks are preserved in their relative positions, but all empty space is removed. For the test input, I identified three main colored regions: the top-left blue (2), the middle red (3), and the lower yellow (7) and green (8) regions. I extracted the minimal bounding rectangles for each color group and stacked them in the same order as in the training outputs, preserving their relative vertical order. The output is an 8x16 grid, with the blue and red regions on top and the yellow and green regions below, tightly packed.",
