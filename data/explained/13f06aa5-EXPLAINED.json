      "reasoningLog": "We are given training examples and a test case. We need to understand the transformation applied to the input grid to get the output grid.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\nExample 1 Input and Output:\n- Input has many 2s, some 4s, 1, and 8.\n- Output: The first row becomes [1,1,...,1,0] and the last column becomes mostly 8 (except the first row). Also, in the middle, we see that the pattern of the input is preserved but with some changes, and the last element of each row (except the first) is 8. Also, the first column becomes [0,2,2,...,2]? Actually, looking:\n  Row0: [1,1,...,1,0]\n  Row1: [2,2,...,2,8] but note the 1 in the middle? Actually, row1: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,8] -> so the 10th element is 1? And the last is 8.\n\nBut let's map to emojis to understand:\n\nUsing the mapping:\n0: ⬛\n1: ✅\n2: 👽\n4: 🪐\n8: ♥\n\nExample 1 Input (first few rows and columns, but note the pattern in the middle):\nRow 3: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,1,4,4,2,2] -> 👽👽...👽🪐🪐✅🪐🪐👽👽\nOutput Row 3: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,1,4,4,2,8] -> same until the last element: 8 (♥) instead of 2 (👽)\n\nAlso, the entire first row of output: [1,1,...,1,0] -> ✅✅...✅⬛\nAnd the first column: \nRow0: 1 (✅) -> but note row0 in input was [2,2,...] but output row0 is [1,1,...,1,0] so completely changed.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2:\n\nInput: \nRow 3: [1,1,1,8,1,1,1,8,8,3,8,8,1] -> ✅✅✅♥✅✅✅♥♥👤♥♥✅\nOutput Row 3: [2,1,1,8,1,1,1,8,8,3,8,8,1] -> 👽✅✅♥✅✅✅♥♥👤♥♥✅\n\nNote: In output, the first column is [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] (except row0 which is 0) and row0 is [0,3,3,...,3]? Actually:\nRow0: [0,3,3,...,3] -> ⬛👤👤...👤\nRow1: [2,1,1,...,1,3?] -> 👽✅✅...✅ but then the last element? Actually row1: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1] -> so first element 2 (👽), then 1s (✅) except the 10th is 3 (👤) and last is 1? Wait, the row has 13 elements? The output row1: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1] -> so the 10th is 3.\n\nBut note the input row0 was all 1s (✅) and output row0 is [0,3,3,...,3] (⬛👤👤...👤) and the first column of output (from row1 to row10) is all 2 (👽) except row0.\n\nNow Example 3:\n\nInput: \nRow0: [3,3,...,3] -> 👤👤...👤\nRow1: [3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3] -> 👤👤👤👤✅✅✅👤👤👤👤👤\nRow2: [3,3,3,1,1,6,1,1,3,3,3,3] -> 👤👤👤✅✅🛸✅✅👤👤👤👤\nOutput: \nRow0: same? [3,3,...,3] -> 👤👤...👤\nRow1: same? [3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3] -> 👤👤👤👤✅✅✅👤👤👤👤👤\nRow2: same? [3,3,3,1,1,6,1,1,3,3,3,3] -> 👤👤👤✅✅🛸✅✅👤👤👤👤\nBut then row4: [3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3] -> 👤👤👤👤👤🛸👤👤👤👤👤👤\nRow6: [3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3] -> same as row4?\nAnd row8, row10, row12: same pattern? And the last row: [6,6,...,6] -> 🛸🛸...🛸\n\nSo the transformation: \n- The first three rows are unchanged? \n- Then starting from row4, every even-indexed row (if we count row0 as index0) has a 6 in the 6th column? Actually row4 (index4), row6 (index6), row8 (index8), row10 (index10), row12 (index12) and then row14 (index14) is all 6? But note the grid has 15 rows? The input has 15 rows? Let me count:\n\nInput: 15 rows (index0 to 14) and 12 columns? Actually the input for example3 has 15 rows and 12 columns? The output has the same number of rows and columns? \n\nBut note: the output row indices that change: row4, row6, row8, row10, row12, row14. That's every other row starting from row4? And row14 is all 6.\n\nNow the test case:\n\nInput: 15 rows, 17 columns? \nWe have to produce the output.\n\nLooking at the correct answer for test case:\n\nRow0: [0,8,8,...,8,0] -> ⬛♥♥...♥⬛\nRow1: [1,4,2,4,...,5] -> ✅🪐👽🪐...🌍\n...\nRow14: [1,4,...,4,5] -> ✅🪐...🪐🌍\n\nPatterns from training:\n\nWe see in Example1 and Example2 that the output:\n- The first row is changed to start with 1 (or 0) and end with 0 (or something) and then the last column is set to 8 (in Example1) or not set in Example2? \nIn Example1: last column becomes 8 for rows 1 to 11? \nIn Example2: the last column is not consistently set to 8? Row0: last element 3? Row1: last element 1? So not the same.\n\nBut note: in both Example1 and Example2, the output has:\n- The first row is completely changed: in Example1 it's all 1s except last 0; in Example2 it's 0 followed by all 3s? \n- The first column (except row0) is set to 2 in both? In Example1: row1 to row11: first element is 2? In Example2: row1 to row10: first element is 2.\n\nSo a common pattern in training:\n1. The first row is transformed to a new pattern (different in each example).\n2. The first column (from row1 to the end) is set to a constant (2 in both examples).\n\nAdditionally, in Example1, the last column (from row1 to row11) is set to 8? But in Example2, the last column is not set to a constant? It varies.\n\nBut in Example2, the last element of row0 is 3, row1 is 1, row2 is 1, ... row10 is 1? So not constant.\n\nHowever, note that in Example3 the transformation was different: it added 6s in specific positions and then the last row all 6s.\n\nSo we must find a transformation that fits all training and the test.\n\nLooking at the test input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow0: all 4s -> 🪐🪐...🪐\nOutput Row0: [0,8,8,...,8,0] -> ⬛♥♥...♥⬛\n\nInput Row1: [4,4,2,4,...] -> 🪐🪐👽🪐...\nOutput Row1: [1,4,2,4,...,5] -> ✅🪐👽🪐...🌍\n\nNote: the first element of row1 in output is 1 (✅) and the last is 5 (🌍). Similarly, in row2: first is 1, last is 5? Row2 output: [1,4,2,2,...,5] -> first 1, last 5.\n\nIn fact, every row in the output (except row0) starts with 1 and ends with 5? Let's check:\n\nRow0: [0,8,...,8,0] -> starts and ends with 0? But row0 is special.\n\nRow1: starts with 1, ends with 5.\nRow2: starts with 1, ends with 5.\n...\nRow14: starts with 1, ends with 5.\n\nSo the transformation for the test case:\n- Row0: set to [0] then 8s then [0] at the end? Actually [0,8,8,...,8,0] -> so first and last are 0, the rest 8.\n- For rows 1 to 14: set the first element to 1 and the last element to 5? And then the rest of the row is the same as input? But look:\n\nInput Row1: [4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] -> 17 elements\nOutput Row1: [1,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5] \n\nSo the output row1: \n- First element changed to 1.\n- The 8th element (index7? since 0-indexed) was 4 in input, now 8? \n- The last element changed to 5.\n\nSimilarly, row2 input: [4,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]\nOutput: [1,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5] -> so only first and last changed? And the 8th element is still 4? But in row1 output the 8th element was changed to 8? \n\nWait, in row1 output, the 8th element (index7) is 8? But input row1 index7 was 4? So it changed. Similarly, in row3:\n\nInput row3: [4,4,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4]\nOutput row3: [1,4,1,2,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,5] -> index7 changed to 8? \n\nRow4 input: [4,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,4]\nOutput: [1,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,5] -> index7 is 4? Not changed? Why?\n\nIn row4, index7 in input is 4? Output is 4? So not always changed? But in row1, row3, and row5: \n\nRow5 input: [4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,5,4,4,4,4]\nOutput: [1,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,2,5,4,5,4,5] -> index7 changed to 8? And also the last but one? \n\nBut note: the pattern might be that for each row, if the row index is odd? Or something? Let's see the row indices (0-indexed):\n\nRow0: special.\nRow1 (index1): index7 changed to 8? (was 4)\nRow2 (index2): no change at index7? (was 4, remains 4)\nRow3 (index3): index7 changed to 8? (was 4, becomes 8)\nRow4 (index4): no change? (was 4, remains 4)\nRow5 (index5): index7 changed to 8? (was 4, becomes 8) and also at index14 (last but one? index14 is the 15th element? 17 elements: indices 0 to 16. So row5 output: [1,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,2,5,4,5,4,5] -> so index7 is 8, index14 is 5? and index15 is 4? and index16 is 5? \n\nWait, in row5 input: index12 was 5? Output: index12 is 5? But in output, index14 and index15 are 5 and 4? But input had at index12:5, index13:4, index14:4, index15:4, index16:4? So output changed index14 to 5? and index15 to 5? Wait, output row5: ... [2,5,4,5,4,5] -> so at index12:2? No:\n\nOutput row5: [1,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,2,5,4,5,4,5] -> \nindex0:1 (changed)\nindex1:4 (same as input? input row5 index1:4? yes)\nindex2:2 (same? input index2:2? yes)\nindex3:4 (same? input index3:4? yes)\nindex4:4 (same)\nindex5:4 (same)\nindex6:4 (same)\nindex7:8 (changed from 4)\nindex8:4 (same)\nindex9:4 (same)\nindex10:4 (same)\nindex11:2 (same? input index11:4? Wait, input row5: [4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,5,4,4,4,4] -> so index11 is 2? Yes, same.\nindex12:5 (same? input index12:5? Yes)\nindex13:4 (same? input index13:4? Yes)\nindex14:5 (changed from 4? input index14:4? Output:5)\nindex15:4 (same? input index15:4? Output:4? But output has 4? Wait, output: index14:5, index15:4, index16:5 -> so index14 changed from 4 to 5, index16 changed from 4 to 5? And index15 remains 4? \n\nBut also the first element and last element changed: first to 1, last to 5? And index16 was last? So last element set to 5? But then index14 and index16 set to 5? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is:\n\n1. For row0: \n   - Set the first element to 0.\n   - Set the last element to 0.\n   - For elements in between, set to 8? But the input row0 was all 4s? So [0,8,8,...,8,0]\n\n2. For other rows:\n   - Set the first element to 1.\n   - Set the last element to 5.\n   - For the element at column index 7 (0-indexed? i.e., the 8th column) and for rows that are odd? Row1 (index1, odd): set to 8? Row2 (even): leave? Row3 (odd): set to 8? Row4 (even): leave? Row5 (odd): set to 8? \n   But row7 (index7, odd): output row7: [1,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,5] -> so index7 set to 8? And row7 input index7:4? So yes.\n\n   Also, in row5 output, we see that index14 and index15? But index14 and index16? Actually, in row5 output, the changes are at:\n   - index0: set to 1\n   - index7: set to 8 (because row index5 is odd? 5%2=1 -> odd)\n   - index16: set to 5 (last element)\n   - and additionally, index14 and index15? index14 is set to 5? and index15 set to 4? But input index15 was 4? So only index14 changed to 5? Why?\n\n   Let's check row5 input: [4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,5,4,4,4,4]\n   Output: [1,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,2,5,4,5,4,5] -> so changes at:\n   index0: 1 (from 4)\n   index7: 8 (from 4)\n   index14: 5 (from 4) -> index14 is the 15th element? 0-indexed: position 14 -> the 15th element? \n   index16: 5 (from 4)\n\n   Also, index15 is 4 (same as input? input index15 was 4? Yes, so not changed? But output index15 is 4? So only index14 changed? \n\n   Why index14? Maybe because it's the second last? But then why not change all second last? \n\n   Alternatively, note that in row5, there is a 5 at index12? And then the output sets index14 and index16 to 5? But that seems specific.\n\n   Looking at the training examples for clues.\n\n   In Example1, the output changed the last column to 8 for many rows? But not the last row? And the first column to 2? \n\n   In Example2, the first column (from row1) to 2? \n\n   But in test case, the first column for rows1-14 is set to 1? \n\n   Another idea: perhaps the transformation is adding a border? \n\n   For the test case output:\n   - Row0: border top: starts with 0, ends with 0, and in between 8s? \n   - For the sides: left side for rows1-14: set to 1? Right side: set to 5? \n   - And then for the inner part, but we see changes at column7 for odd rows? \n\n   Also, in the last row (row14) of output, it ends with 5? And row0 ends with 0? \n\n   But also, the bottom border? Row14: first element 1? last element 5? But row0 is the top border.\n\n   So maybe the transformation is:\n\n   Step 1: Create a border:\n      - Top row: set to 0 at the corners and 8 in between? Why 8? \n      - Left column (except top): set to 1\n      - Right column (except top): set to 5\n      - Bottom row? But row14 is not all set to something? Only the first and last are set? But in row14, the first is set to 1 (which is the left border) and last to 5 (right border), so the bottom corners are set by the left/right border? \n\n   Step 2: For the inner grid, there are additional changes at specific positions? Only at column 7 (index7) for rows that are odd (row index odd)? And set to 8? \n\n   And in row5, why index14 changed to 5? Maybe it's an error? Or perhaps because there was a 5 at index12? And then it propagates? \n\n   But look at the input row5: it has a 5 at index12? And then output sets index14 to 5? Why?\n\n   Alternatively, in row5 output, we see that after the 5 at index12, the next elements are set to 5 at index14 and index16? But index13 and index15 are left as 4? \n\n   That seems like a pattern: after a 5, every other element is set to 5? But the input at index13 is 4, index14:4, index15:4, index16:4? Output sets index14 and index16 to 5? \n\n   But then why not in other rows? For example, row3 input: has a 2 at index12? But output row3: [1,4,1,2,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,5] -> so index12 is 2, and then index14 and index16 are not changed to 2? They are 4 and 4? Then index16 is 5 (because of border).\n\n   So only in row5 we have that change? \n\n   Let's check row4 output: [1,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,5] -> no extra changes.\n   Row6 output: [1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,5] -> no extra changes? \n   Row7 output: [1,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,5] -> no extra changes.\n\n   Only row5 has extra changes: at index14 and index16 set to 5? But index16 is the last element, which we set to 5 anyway? So only index14 is extra? \n\n   And why? Because in the input, row5 has a 5 at index12? And then at a fixed offset? \n\n   This is complex.\n\n   Let's look at the training examples to see if there's a common transformation.\n\n   In Example1, the output changed the first row completely and then the first column and last column for other rows? But not exactly.\n\n   Another approach: perhaps the transformation is conditional based on the input values.\n\n   In Example1, the output has in the first row: all 1s and last 0? And then in the last column, for rows that are not the first, set to 8? But why?\n\n   In terms of emojis, what might it mean?\n\n   For the test case, the correct output has:\n   - Row0: ⬛ then many ♥ then ⬛ -> perhaps a frame of peace but with nothing at corners.\n   - For other rows: start with ✅ (agreement), then the planet emoji and alien emojis as in input, but at column8 (index7) for odd rows, set to ♥ (peace), and end with 🌍 (Earth). Also, in row5, where there is a 5 (Earth) at index12, then at index14 and index16 set to Earth? But index16 is already set to Earth by the border.\n\n   So the additional change in row5: only index14 set to 5? \n\n   Why index14? Maybe because it's two positions after the 5 at index12? \n\n   But then in other rows, if there is a 5, do we do the same? In the input, only row5 has a 5? Let's check:\n\n   Input rows:\n   Row0: no 5\n   Row1: no 5\n   Row2: no 5\n   Row3: no 5\n   Row4: no 5\n   Row5: has 5 at index12\n   Row6: no 5\n   ...\n\n   So only row5 has a 5 in the input? So in the output, we set index14 to 5? \n\n   The rule might be: if in a row there is a 5, then at a fixed offset from it, set to 5? But offset by 2 columns? From index12 to index14? \n\n   But then why not also set index13? It's set to 4 (same as input).\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in our observation? Let's count the indices again.\n\n   The row has 17 elements, indices 0 to 16.\n   In row5 input: index12 is 5.\n   In output, index14 is set to 5? And index12 is still 5? So we are setting two positions after the 5 to 5? \n\n   But then what about the last element? It's set to 5 by the border rule.\n\n   So the transformation for the test case seems to be:\n\n   1. For row0:\n        - Set element0 to 0.\n        - Set element16 to 0.\n        - Set elements1 to15 to 8.\n\n   2. For row i (i>=1):\n        - Set element0 to 1.\n        - Set element16 to 5.\n        - If the row index i is odd, set element7 to 8.\n        - Additionally, if in the row there is a 5 in the input, then for each occurrence, set the element two positions to the right to 5? But in this case, only one 5 at index12, so set index14 to 5.\n\n   But in the output, index14 was changed to 5, and index12 is still 5? So we are not overwriting the existing 5.\n\n   Now, does this match the training examples? \n\n   Example1: \n   Input has no 5? So no additional change.\n   But in Example1, the last column is set to 8 for many rows? In our test case rule, we only set element7 to 8 for odd rows, not the last column.\n\n   Example2:\n   Input has a 3 at row3 index9? But 3 is not 5? So no additional change.\n\n   Example3:\n   Input has 6 at row2 index5? But 6 is not 5? So no additional change.\n\n   But in Example1, the output has the last column set to 8 for rows1-11? In our test case, we are not doing that.\n\n   So the transformations are different in each example? That can't be.\n\n   Perhaps the border idea is common, but the additional rules are example-specific? But the problem says \"determine the logic used to solve it\" for the test case, given the training. But the training has different transformations.\n\n   Maybe the transformation type is grid overlay or something.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since we have to explain in simple terms, let's focus on the test case and the provided correct answer.\n\n   For the test case, the logic might be:\n\n   - The top row is replaced with a new row: start and end with 0 (nothing), and in between peace (8).\n   - For the other rows:\n        - The first element is set to 1 (agreement).\n        - The last element is set to 5 (Earth).\n        - In the middle, at the 8th position (column index 7), if the row number is odd, set it to 8 (peace).\n        - Also, if there is a 5 in the row, then two positions after it, set to 5 (Earth). In this case, only in row5.\n\n   Now, in simple terms for the user.\n\n   Also, for the alien meaning: the aliens are showing a message where they frame the image with agreement and Earth at the sides, and at the top they show peace. In the middle, on odd rows, they mark a peace symbol, and if there's an Earth symbol, they extend it to two more places. This might indicate a desire for peace and friendship, extending Earth's influence.\n\n   Confidence in the pattern: 70% because it fits the test case output, but we are not sure if it generalizes.\n\n   Now, let's formalize the response.\n\n   PatternDescription: The aliens are adding a border and making specific changes inside. The top row has a peace frame with nothing at corners. For other rows, the left side is agreement, the right side is Earth, and on every other row (odd rows), there's a peace symbol in the middle. Also, if they find an Earth symbol in a row, they add more Earth symbols two positions to the right.\n\n   SolvingStrategy:\n   - Step 1: For the first row, set the first and last element to 0 (nothing), and all in between to 8 (peace).\n   - Step 2: For each subsequent row:\n        - Set the first element to 1 (agreement).\n        - Set the last element to 5 (Earth).\n        - If the row index (starting from 0) is odd, set the element at position 7 (the 8th column) to 8 (peace).\n        - Scan the row for any 5 (Earth) in the input. For each 5 found at position j, set the element at position j+2 to 5 (Earth), if it exists.\n\n   Hints:\n   - Hint 1: The aliens are framing the message with special symbols on the edges.\n   - Hint 2: Look for odd-numbered rows (1,3,5,...) to find an additional peace symbol in the middle.\n   - Hint 3: If you see an Earth symbol in a row, you might need to add more Earth symbols a few steps to the right.\n\n   AlienMeaning: The aliens are likely showing a message of peace and friendship. The peace symbols and the extension of Earth symbols might indicate a wish to spread peace and include Earth in their community. This suggests friendly, not hostile, intentions.\n\n   Confidence: 75 (because it explains the test case, but the training examples have different transformations, so this might be specific to this puzzle)\n\n   AlienMeaningConfidence: 60 (speculative)\n\n   But note: the user sees emojis, so we should describe in emojis.\n\n   However, in the solving strategy, we have to say \"set to 5\" but the user sees emojis. So we should say \"set to 🌍\" etc.\n\n   The instructions say: \"If they need to switch to thinking of the puzzle as numbers and not emojis, then mention that!\" So we can mention that for precise rules, it's easier to use numbers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the emoji names.\n\n   Let's write the response.",
