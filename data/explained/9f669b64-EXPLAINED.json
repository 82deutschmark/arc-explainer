      "patternDescription": "The transformation rules depend on the type and relative properties of the non-background shapes in the grid. Shapes are classified as either 'complex' (not a simple rectangle) or 'simple rectangle'. Simple rectangles are further classified by their dimensions (square, taller than wide, or wider than tall) and area. Each distinct non-background shape undergoes one of three transformations: stationary, translation, or splitting.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. **Identify all distinct non-background shapes:** For each unique non-background color, extract its coordinates, determine its bounding box (top_row, left_col, bottom_row, right_col), calculate its height (H), width (W), and area (H*W). Classify if it's a simple rectangle or a complex shape (i.e., not a perfect rectangle). \n2. **Apply Stationary Rule:** Any shape identified as 'complex' remains stationary in its original position. Additionally, among the simple rectangles, any rectangle that is 'taller than wide' (H > W) and is *not* the smallest area rectangle, also remains stationary.\n3. **Apply Translation Rule:** The simple rectangle with the **smallest area** is the translating shape. Its movement depends on its dimensions:\n    *   If the translating shape is **square** (H == W): It moves to the **closest grid edge** (top, bottom, left, or right) without changing its internal alignment.\n    *   If the translating shape is **taller than wide** (H > W): It moves to the **furthest vertical grid edge** (either row 0 or row 10-H, whichever is further from its starting row).\n    *   If the translating shape is **wider than tall** (W > H): (No example, but by symmetry, it would move to the furthest horizontal grid edge).\n4. **Apply Splitting Rule:** The remaining simple rectangle (if any) is the splitting shape. This rule applies only if the remaining shape is 'wider than tall' (W > H). It splits horizontally into two equal halves. Each half then moves outwards by one unit from the center of the original shape, maintaining its original row position. If no such shape exists, no splitting occurs.\n5. **Construct the Output Grid:** Start with a grid filled with the background color (7). Then, draw all stationary shapes in their original positions, followed by the translated shape in its new position, and finally the split halves (if any) in their new positions.\n\n**Applying to the Test Case:**\n*   **Input Grid Analysis:**\n    *   **Shape 2 (blue):** Coordinates form a complex, L-shaped structure. (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (5,0). This is a **complex shape**.\n    *   **Shape 9 (orange):** Bounding box (2,4)-(3,5). H=2, W=2. Area=4. This is a **simple rectangle (square)**.\n    *   **Shape 8 (pink):** Bounding box (1,8)-(4,9). H=4, W=2. Area=8. This is a **simple rectangle (taller than wide)**.\n\n*   **Transformation Steps:**\n    1.  **Stationary Shapes:**\n        *   Shape 2 (complex) remains stationary.\n        *   Among simple rectangles (9s, 8s): Shape 8 (4x2) is taller than wide (H=4, W=2) and is not the smallest area (Area=8, smallest is 9s with Area=4). Therefore, Shape 8 remains stationary.\n    2.  **Translating Shape:**\n        *   The simple rectangle with the smallest area is Shape 9 (2x2, Area=4). It is a square.\n        *   Original position: (2,4)-(3,5). \n        *   Closest edge calculation: Distance to top (row 0) = 2. Distance to bottom (row 9) = 10-3 = 7. Distance to left (col 0) = 4. Distance to right (col 9) = 10-5 = 5. The closest edge is the top edge (row 0).\n        *   New position for Shape 9: (0,4)-(1,5).\n    3.  **Splitting Shape:**\n        *   No remaining simple rectangle is wider than tall (Shape 8 is taller than wide). Therefore, no splitting occurs.\n\n*   **Predicted Output Grid Construction:**\n    1.  Initialize a 10x10 grid with 7s.\n    2.  Place stationary Shape 2:\n        `grid[0][0]=2, grid[1][0]=2, grid[1][1]=2, grid[2][0]=2, grid[2][1]=2, grid[2][2]=2, grid[2][3]=2, grid[3][0]=2, grid[3][1]=2, grid[3][2]=2, grid[3][3]=2, grid[4][0]=2, grid[4][1]=2, grid[5][0]=2`\n    3.  Place stationary Shape 8:\n        `grid[1][8]=8, grid[1][9]=8, grid[2][8]=8, grid[2][9]=8, grid[3][8]=8, grid[3][9]=8, grid[4][8]=8, grid[4][9]=8`\n    4.  Place translated Shape 9:\n        `grid[0][4]=9, grid[0][5]=9, grid[1][4]=9, grid[1][5]=9`\n\n*   **Resulting Grid:**\n    [[2,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7],\n     [2,2,7,7,9,9,7,7,8,8],\n     [2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8],\n     [2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8],\n     [2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8],\n     [2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],\n     [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],\n     [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],\n     [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],\n     [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]]",
