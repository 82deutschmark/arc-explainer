      "patternDescription": "The puzzle involves a reflection of the grid combined with color replacement, where certain symbols are mirrored and swapped to a new symbol.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, look at the puzzle as emojis: You have a grid with ⬛ (nothing) and 🌍 (Earth) in certain spots. To solve it, imagine flipping the grid, like reflecting it over a line (maybe horizontally or diagonally), and then swap the 🌍 with 🪐 (their planet) in the flipped spots. If this is confusing with emojis, switch to thinking of it as numbers: The number 5 (🌍) gets replaced with 4 (🪐) in positions that are symmetric or mirrored from the original grid. For example, in your grid, the 🌍 spots are flipped to new spots, and those new spots get 🪐 instead. Step 1: Draw the grid and find the 🌍 positions. Step 2: Flip the grid in your mind (try horizontal flip first). Step 3: Put 🪐 where the flipped 🌍 would be, and fill the rest with ⬛.",
      "hints": [
        "Symmetry is key – the output grid looks like a mirror of the input",
        "🌍 (5) is always swapped to 🪐 (4) in mirrored positions",

      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to communicate a swap or takeover, like they're showing their planet (🪐) invading or replacing Earth's spots (🌍), which could mean they have hostile intentions, perhaps warning of an exchange or conflict rather than peace.",
