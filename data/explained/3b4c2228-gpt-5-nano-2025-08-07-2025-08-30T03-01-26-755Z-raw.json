  "solvingStrategy": "We analyze training examples to infer a higher-level transformation mapping a 7x7 grid with colors {0,2,3} to a 3x3 indicator grid. Across examples, the output is a 3x3 matrix with 1s placed on some diagonal positions and 0s otherwise. The pattern appears to reflect presence/absence of certain subpatterns or blocks within the 7x7 input (e.g., clusters of color 3 or 2) mapped to a 3-bit flag per row/column. Some examples show two diagonals active (Ex1, Ex4), one (Ex2), or all three (Ex3). Based on the test inputs, I hypothesize Test 1 corresponds to two active diagonals (matching Ex1/Ex4 style), yielding [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]. Test 2 appears to contain all three distinct subpatterns, yielding the identity matrix [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]. This approach aligns with observed outputs and keeps consistency with the idea of mapping presence of patterns to a 3x3 indicator grid.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Identify the mapping from 7x7 input grids to 3x3 outputs in all training examples.",
    "Observe that outputs are 3x3 binary matrices with 1s placed along diagonal positions in various configurations.",
    "Infer that the 3x3 matrix encodes the presence/absence of three distinct subpatterns (or regions) in the 7x7 grid, corresponding to the three diagonal positions.",
    "Apply heuristic: Test 1 likely has two subpatterns present -> first two diagonal positions set to 1. Test 2 likely has all three subpatterns present -> full diagonal ones.",
    "Produce two predictions accordingly."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "Transform input by detecting three distinct subpatterns within the 7x7 grid and encoding their presence as a 3x3 diagonal indicator. 1 on (0,0) indicates pattern A present, (1,1) indicates pattern B present, (2,2) indicates pattern C present; 0 otherwise.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm (best): Scan predefined subregions corresponding to the three potential patterns, set 1 in the diagonal positions for regions where the pattern is detected; else 0.",
    "Math: Represent as a three-flag vector [A_present, B_present, C_present], map to diag matrix diag(A,B,C).",
    "Emojis: ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸª -> each color block presence indicates a diagonal 1; assemble into 3x3 diagonal matrix."
