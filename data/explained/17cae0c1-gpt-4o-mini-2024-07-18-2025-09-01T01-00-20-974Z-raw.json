  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves analyzing the patterns in the training examples to identify how the input values are mapped to the output values. Each unique value in the input grid corresponds to a specific value in the output grid based on its position and frequency. The output grid appears to be a transformation based on the counts of the unique values in the input grid, with certain values being replaced by others based on their spatial arrangement.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Examine the first training example to identify how the values are transformed. The 5s in the input seem to correspond to higher numbers in the output, while 0s correspond to lower numbers.",
    "Look for patterns in the second and third examples to see if the transformation is consistent. The presence of 5s seems to lead to higher output values, while 0s lead to lower values.",
    "Identify that the output grid is consistent in its row structure, suggesting a uniform transformation across the rows based on the input grid's structure.",
    "Apply the same transformation logic to the test case, focusing on how the 5s and 0s in the input will affect the output."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation replaces the input values based on their frequency and position in the grid. Specifically, 5s are transformed into higher values (6 or 9), while 0s are transformed into lower values (1, 3, or 4) depending on their arrangement and proximity to other numbers.",
  "hints": [
    "For the best algorithm: Count occurrences of each number in the input grid and map them to specific output values based on their frequency and position.",
    "Mathematical approach: If value = 5, then output = 6 or 9; if value = 0, then output = 1, 3, or 4 depending on position.",
