      "reasoningLog": "We are given several examples and a test case. The task is to transform an input grid into an output grid. Let's analyze the examples to find the pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[2,2],[6,6],[8,8],[8,8]]\nOutput: [[2],[6],[8]]\n\nNotice that the input has multiple rows. Each row in the input has identical numbers. The output has one row for each distinct row in the input? But wait, the input has two rows of [8,8] but the output has only one [8]. So it's not about distinct rows? Let's look at the values: the output is taking the distinct numbers that appear in the entire grid? But then why is the output a grid with one column? And note the output has three rows: [2], [6], [8]. Also, the input has two [8,8] rows but the output has only one [8]. So it seems we are removing duplicates? But not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, observe that the input has multiple rows that are identical. In fact, the input rows are:\n[2,2] -> row0\n[6,6] -> row1\n[8,8] -> row2\n[8,8] -> row3\n\nThe output has:\n[2]\n[6]\n[8]\n\nSo it's as if we are taking the first occurrence of each distinct row? But then why are the rows being reduced to a single element? Also, in Example 1, each row has identical elements, so we are taking one representative from each distinct row? But then why the output is a single number per row? Because the row is [2,2] and we output [2]? So it's taking the unique element in the row? But then why not output the entire row? Because the row is all same? So maybe we are collapsing each row to a set of unique elements? But in this case, each row has one unique element? So we get a single number.\n\nBut look at Example 2:\nInput: [[3,4,6],[3,4,6],[3,4,6]]\nOutput: [[3,4,6]]\n\nHere, all rows are the same. The output is one row: [3,4,6]. So we are collapsing the entire input to a set of distinct rows? But then we would have one row. However, the output is not a set of distinct rows? Because the output row is the same as the input row? But in Example 1, the output row is a single number? So maybe we are doing two things:\n\n1. First, we remove duplicate consecutive rows? But in Example 1, the two [8,8] rows are consecutive? They are the last two. So we remove the duplicate consecutive row? Then we get:\n   [2,2]\n   [6,6]\n   [8,8]\nBut then the output is [[2],[6],[8]]? So then we are also collapsing each row to its unique element? Because each row has identical numbers.\n\nBut Example 3:\nInput: [[2,3,3,8,1],[2,3,3,8,1],[2,3,3,8,1]]\nOutput: [[2,3,8,1]]\n\nHere, all rows are the same. The output is one row: [2,3,8,1]. Notice that the input row has duplicates: two 3's. But the output row does not have duplicates? It has only one 3. So the output row is the unique elements in the row? But in the order they first appear? Because 2, then 3, then 8, then 1. So for each row, we are removing duplicate numbers? But wait, the output is a single row? Why? Because we also removed the duplicate rows? Since all rows are the same, we collapse the entire grid to one row? And then within that row, we remove duplicate numbers? But then in Example 1, we had multiple distinct rows? So we collapse each row individually? But in Example 1, we have three distinct rows? So we get three rows in the output? And each output row is the unique elements of the corresponding input row? But in Example 1, each input row had identical numbers, so the unique element is just that number.\n\nBut now Example 4:\nInput: [[4,4,4,4],[4,4,4,4],[2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2],[8,8,8,8],[3,3,3,3]]\nOutput: [[4],[2],[8],[3]]\n\nHere, we have:\n- Two rows of [4,4,4,4] -> becomes [4] (and we take only one row because they are consecutive duplicates? But then we have two [2,2,2,2] and then two others? But the output has four rows: [4], [2], [8], [3]. So we are not collapsing consecutive duplicate rows? Because if we did, we would have:\n   [4,4,4,4] (first occurrence)\n   [2,2,2,2] (first occurrence)\n   [8,8,8,8]\n   [3,3,3,3]\nThen we collapse each row to unique elements: [4], [2], [8], [3]. But note that the input has two of each of the first two? So we are removing duplicate consecutive rows? But then we should only have one [4] and one [2]? But the output has four rows? Wait, no: the output has four rows because we have four distinct rows? But in the input, we have six rows: two of [4], two of [2], one of [8], one of [3]. So after removing consecutive duplicates? We would get:\n   [4,4,4,4] (first of the two)\n   [2,2,2,2] (first of the two)\n   [8,8,8,8]\n   [3,3,3,3]\nThen we collapse each row to unique elements? So we get four rows: [4], [2], [8], [3]. That matches.\n\nBut what about non consecutive duplicates? Look at Example 5:\nInput: [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[1,1,1]]\nOutput: [[1],[2],[1]]\n\nHere, we have:\nRow0: [1,1,1]\nRow1: [2,2,2]\nRow2: [1,1,1]\n\nIf we remove consecutive duplicates? They are not consecutive duplicates because row0 and row2 are the same but separated by row1. So we don't remove any row? Then we collapse each row to unique elements: [1], [2], [1]. So output: [[1],[2],[1]]. That matches.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n1. Remove consecutive duplicate rows? Actually, we don't remove any row that is the same as the previous? We just keep the first occurrence of a consecutive run? But in Example 5, we have two [1,1,1] rows that are not consecutive? They are separated? So we keep both? So we are not removing non consecutive duplicates? Only consecutive duplicates? Then:\n\n   Step 1: Traverse the rows from top to bottom. If a row is the same as the row above, skip it (i.e., remove the duplicate consecutive row). Otherwise, keep it.\n\n   Then, Step 2: For each kept row, remove duplicate numbers in the row? But only consecutive duplicates? Or all duplicates? In Example 3, the input row is [2,3,3,8,1]. After removing duplicates in the row? We want [2,3,8,1]. How? We remove duplicate numbers? But note: the two 3's are consecutive? So we remove consecutive duplicate numbers? But what if they are not consecutive? Example 3 doesn't have non consecutive duplicates? Let's see.\n\n   Example 3 input row: [2,3,3,8,1]. If we remove consecutive duplicates? Then we remove the second 3? So we get [2,3,8,1]. Exactly.\n\n   So for each row, we remove consecutive duplicate numbers? Then we also remove consecutive duplicate rows? But wait, in Example 3, we also have multiple identical rows? So we remove consecutive duplicate rows? Then we get one row? Then for that row, remove consecutive duplicate numbers? Then we get [2,3,8,1].\n\n   Let's test with the test case:\n\n   Input: [[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4],[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4],[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4],[1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]]\n\n   Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicate rows? All rows are the same? So we keep only the first row? Then we have one row: [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]\n\n   Step 2: Remove consecutive duplicate numbers in that row? \n      Start: 1, then 1 -> consecutive duplicates? Remove one? So we get [1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]? But we have to remove consecutive duplicates until no consecutive duplicates? Then:\n        [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4] -> \n        After first pass: remove one 1: becomes [1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]? But then we have 3,3 -> remove one: [1,2,3,3,8,8,4]? Then again 3,3? Remove: [1,2,3,8,8,4]? Then 8,8: remove one: [1,2,3,8,4]. Then no consecutive duplicates? So we get [1,2,3,8,4]. Then the output is a grid with one row: [[1,2,3,8,4]]. But the expected output is [[1,2,3,8,4]]? Yes, that matches.\n\n   Now, let's check with Example 4:\n\n   Input: [[4,4,4,4],[4,4,4,4],[2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2],[8,8,8,8],[3,3,3,3]]\n\n   Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicate rows?\n        Row0: [4,4,4,4] -> keep\n        Row1: same as row0? -> skip\n        Row2: [2,2,2,2] -> not same as row1? But row1 is skipped? Actually, we are comparing to the last kept row? So after row0, row1 is same? skip. Then row2: different? keep. Then row3: same as row2? skip. Then row4: [8,8,8,8] -> different? keep. Then row5: [3,3,3,3] -> different? keep. So we have four rows: [4,4,4,4], [2,2,2,2], [8,8,8,8], [3,3,3,3].\n\n   Step 2: For each row, remove consecutive duplicate numbers? \n        Each row has consecutive duplicates? So for [4,4,4,4]: remove duplicates -> [4]\n        Similarly, [2,2,2,2] -> [2]\n        [8,8,8,8] -> [8]\n        [3,3,3,3] -> [3]\n        So output: [[4],[2],[8],[3]]. Matches.\n\n   Example 5: \n        Input: [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[1,1,1]]\n        Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicates? \n            Row0: keep [1,1,1]\n            Row1: [2,2,2] -> not same as row0? keep\n            Row2: [1,1,1] -> not same as row1? keep. So we keep all three rows.\n        Step 2: \n            [1,1,1] -> [1]\n            [2,2,2] -> [2]\n            [1,1,1] -> [1]\n        Output: [[1],[2],[1]]. Matches.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: [[2,2],[6,6],[8,8],[8,8]]\n        Step 1: \n            Row0: [2,2] -> keep\n            Row1: [6,6] -> not same? keep\n            Row2: [8,8] -> not same? keep? But then row3: same as row2? skip. So we have three rows: [2,2], [6,6], [8,8]\n        Step 2: \n            [2,2] -> [2]\n            [6,6] -> [6]\n            [8,8] -> [8]\n        Output: [[2],[6],[8]]. Matches.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: [[3,4,6],[3,4,6],[3,4,6]]\n        Step 1: \n            Row0: keep\n            Row1: same? skip\n            Row2: same? skip. So only one row: [3,4,6]\n        Step 2: Remove consecutive duplicates? The row is [3,4,6] -> no consecutive duplicates? So it remains [3,4,6]. Output: [[3,4,6]]. Matches.\n\n   So the pattern is:\n      - First, remove consecutive duplicate rows (i.e., if a row is the same as the row immediately above, remove it).\n      - Then, for each remaining row, remove consecutive duplicate numbers (i.e., if a number is the same as the one immediately to its left, remove it).\n\n   This explains the size of the output grid: the number of rows is the number of rows after removing consecutive duplicates. The number of columns for each row is the number of distinct consecutive groups in that row? Actually, we remove consecutive duplicates until each adjacent pair is distinct? So the length of the row after removing consecutive duplicates.\n\n   Now, for the test case, we have four identical rows -> remove three, keep one. Then in that row, we remove consecutive duplicates: \n        [1,1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4] -> \n        The consecutive duplicates: \n          1 and 1 -> remove one -> [1,2,3,3,3,8,8,4]? But we have to do it in one pass? Actually, we can traverse and keep the first of a consecutive run. So:\n          Start: keep 1 (at index0)\n          Then 1 (index1) same? skip.\n          Then 2: different? keep.\n          Then 3: different? keep.\n          Then 3: same? skip.\n          Then 3: same? skip.\n          Then 8: different? keep.\n          Then 8: same? skip.\n          Then 4: different? keep.\n        So we get [1,2,3,8,4]. Then output [[1,2,3,8,4]].\n\n   Therefore, the transformation rule is:\n\n   Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicate rows (keep the first of a run of identical consecutive rows).\n   Step 2: For each remaining row, remove consecutive duplicate numbers (keep the first of a run of identical consecutive numbers in the row).\n\n   Now, how to explain to novices:\n\n   Pattern Description:\n      The output grid is created by first removing any row that is the same as the row above it (we keep only the first row in a run of identical rows). Then, for each of the remaining rows, we remove any number that is the same as the number immediately to its left (we keep only the first number in a run of consecutive identical numbers).\n\n   Solving Strategy for novices:\n\n      1. Look at the rows of the grid from top to bottom.\n      2. If you see two rows in a row (one after the other) that are exactly the same, skip the second one (and any more that are the same in a row). Keep only the first row of each run of identical rows.\n      3. Now, for each row that you kept, look at the numbers in that row from left to right.\n      4. If you see two numbers in a row (one after the other) that are the same, skip the second one (and any more that are the same in a row). Keep only the first number of each run of identical numbers.\n      5. The result is a grid with the rows you kept (from step 2) and each row has the numbers you kept (from step 4).\n\n   Hints:\n\n      - The output grid might have fewer rows because we skip consecutive duplicate rows.\n      - Each row in the output might be shorter because we skip consecutive duplicate numbers in the row.\n      - The order of the rows and the numbers in each row is preserved (we don't change the order, just skip duplicates that are next to each other).\n\n   Confidence: 100% because it fits all examples and the test case.\n\n   But note: in Example 3, the input row has non consecutive duplicates? Actually, no, the row [2,3,3,8,1] has consecutive duplicates (the two 3's). So the rule holds.\n\n   However, what if we have a row with non consecutive duplicates? For example, [1,2,1]? Then removing consecutive duplicates? The two 1's are not consecutive? So we would keep both? So the row becomes [1,2,1]? But we don't have such example? But in the rule we defined, we only remove consecutive duplicates. So [1,2,1] would become [1,2,1] because the 1's are not consecutive? So that is consistent? But we don't have an example? But the problem doesn't say we remove all duplicates, only consecutive? So the rule is about consecutive duplicates.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   Now, to answer the specific question: what governs the size of the correct output grid?\n      - The number of rows in the output is the number of rows after removing consecutive duplicate rows (i.e., keeping only the first row of each consecutive run of identical rows).\n      - The number of columns in each output row is the number of distinct consecutive groups in that row (i.e., after removing consecutive duplicate numbers in the row).\n\n   But note: in the output, each row might have a different length? Yes, because each row may have a different pattern of consecutive duplicates? For example, if one row is [1,1,2] and another is [3,4,4,5], then after step2: [1,2] and [3,4,5]. So the first row has length 2, the second has length 3.\n\n   This matches the examples: in Example 4, each row in the output has length 1. In Example 5, each row has length 1. In Example 3, the output row has length 4? [2,3,8,1] -> 4 elements. In the test case, the output row has length 5: [1,2,3,8,4].\n\n   So the size of the output grid is determined by:\n\n      - The number of consecutive distinct rows (after merging consecutive duplicates).\n      - For each row, the number of consecutive distinct numbers (after merging consecutive duplicates in that row).\n\n   We'll now write the JSON response.",
