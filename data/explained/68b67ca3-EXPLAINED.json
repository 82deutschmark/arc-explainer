      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to find the transformation pattern. Let's look at the inputs and outputs.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[3,0,0,0,2,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,0,0,0,8,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[3,0,2],[8,0,8],[0,1,0]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[2,0,2,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[2,0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[2,2,1],[2,1,0],[3,0,0]]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,0,0,6,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[1,0,0],[0,2,0],[6,0,6]]\n\nAll inputs are 6x6 grids with zeros and some non-zero numbers. Outputs are smaller grids, 3x3 in these cases.\n\nI need to see how the input is transformed to the output.\n\nNotice that in all inputs, the non-zero elements seem to be in specific positions. Let's map the indices.\n\nFor a 6x6 grid, indices from 0 to 5 for rows and columns.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Input row 0: [3,0,0,0,2,0] → non-zero at col 0 and col 4\n- Row 1: all zero\n- Row 2: [8,0,0,0,8,0] → non-zero at col 0 and col 4\n- Row 3: all zero\n- Row 4: [0,0,1,0,0,0] → non-zero at col 2\n- Row 5: all zero\n\nOutput is 3x3: [[3,0,2],[8,0,8],[0,1,0]]\n\nSimilarly, in output, it's like we're taking the non-zero elements and arranging them in a smaller grid.\n\nBut the output isn't just the non-zero elements; it includes zeros where there might be gaps.\n\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like the input grid is divided into blocks or something.\n\nAnother thing: all inputs have rows that are all zeros (rows 1,3,5 in Example 1), and rows with data (0,2,4).\n\nRows with data are even-indexed rows? Row indices: 0,2,4 have data, 1,3,5 are all zero.\n\nSimilarly for columns: in Example 1, non-zero at col 0,2,4? Col 0 has 3 and 8, col 2 has 1, col 4 has 2 and 8.\n\nIn row 0, col 0 and col 4; row 2, col 0 and col 4; row 4, col 2.\n\nColumns with data are col 0,2,4.\n\nIn output, it's a 3x3 grid, which might correspond to the data from rows 0,2,4 and columns 0,2,4 or something.\n\nLet's list the positions of non-zero elements in input and see where they map in output.\n\nIn Example 1 input:\n- (0,0): 3\n- (0,4): 2\n- (2,0): 8\n- (2,4): 8\n- (4,2): 1\n\nOutput: [[3,0,2],[8,0,8],[0,1,0]]\n\nSo, output row 0: [3,0,2] which might correspond to input row 0, but with columns adjusted.\n\nPerhaps the output is taking the values from the intersection of non-zero rows and non-zero columns.\n\nDefine the set of rows that have at least one non-zero element. In Example 1, rows 0,2,4.\n\nSimilarly, columns that have at least one non-zero element: col 0,2,4 (col 0 has 3 and 8, col 2 has 1, col 4 has 2 and 8).\n\nNow, the output is a grid with rows corresponding to the non-zero rows and columns corresponding to the non-zero columns, but ordered.\n\nIn output, it's a 3x3 grid, and the values are placed based on their original positions.\n\nIn Example 1 output:\n- (0,0): 3 from input (0,0)\n- (0,1): 0, but input has no value at (0, something else), wait no, output has zeros where no value is present in that cell of the reduced grid.\n\nThe output grid seems to be the submatrix formed by the rows and columns that contain non-zero elements, but only at the intersections where values exist, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nIn Example 1, non-zero rows: 0,2,4; non-zero columns: 0,2,4.\n\nIf we take the submatrix with these rows and columns, it would be:\n\nRow 0, col 0,2,4: [3,0,2] but input row 0 is [3,0,0,0,2,0], so at col 0,2,4: indices 0,2,4: values 3,0,2 — yes, 3 at col 0, 0 at col 2, 2 at col 4.\n\nSimilarly, row 2, col 0,2,4: [8,0,8] — input row 2: [8,0,0,0,8,0], so col 0:8, col 2:0, col 4:8.\n\nRow 4, col 0,2,4: [0,1,0] — input row 4: [0,0,1,0,0,0], so col 0:0, col 2:1, col 4:0.\n\nPerfect! So the output is the 3x3 submatrix formed by the rows that have non-zero elements and the columns that have non-zero elements, with the rows and columns ordered by their indices.\n\nIn this case, rows are 0,2,4 and columns are 0,2,4, so we take the values at those intersections.\n\nNow, check Example 2.\n\nInput: [[2,0,2,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[2,0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nNon-zero rows: row 0 has non-zero at col 0,2,4? [2,0,2,0,1,0] so non-zero at col 0,2,4.\n\nCol 0: 2, col 2:2, col 4:1.\n\nRow 2: [2,0,1,0,0,0] non-zero at col 0,2.\n\nCol 0:2, col 2:1.\n\nRow 4: [3,0,0,0,0,0] non-zero only at col 0.\n\nNow, columns with non-zero elements: col 0 has values in row 0,2,4; col 2 has values in row 0,2; col 4 has value only in row 0? col 4 has 1 in row 0, and in row 2 it's 0, but col 4 might be considered if it has non-zero somewhere.\n\nIn row 2, col 4 is 0, but since col 4 has a non-zero in row 0, it should be included.\n\nSimilarly, col 0,2,4 have non-zero values.\n\nNon-zero columns: col 0,2,4.\n\nNon-zero rows: 0,2,4.\n\nNow, submatrix with rows 0,2,4 and columns 0,2,4.\n\nRow 0, col 0,2,4: [2,2,1] — input row 0: at col 0:2, col 2:2, col 4:1 → [2,2,1]\n\nRow 2, col 0,2,4: [2,1,0] — input row 2: at col 0:2, col 2:1, col 4:0 → [2,1,0]\n\nRow 4, col 0,2,4: [3,0,0] — input row 4: at col 0:3, col 2:0, col 4:0 → [3,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output: [[2,2,1],[2,1,0],[3,0,0]]\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow Example 3.\n\nInput: [[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,0,0,6,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nNon-zero rows: row 0 has non-zero only at col 0? [1,0,0,0,0,0] so col 0:1\n\nRow 2: [0,0,2,0,0,0] col 2:2\n\nRow 4: [6,0,0,0,6,0] col 0:6, col 4:6\n\nNon-zero columns: col 0 has values in row 0 and 4; col 2 has value in row 2; col 4 has value in row 4.\n\nSo non-zero columns: col 0,2,4\n\nNon-zero rows: 0,2,4\n\nSubmatrix with rows 0,2,4 and columns 0,2,4.\n\nRow 0, col 0,2,4: [1,0,0] — input row 0: col 0:1, col 2:0, col 4:0 → [1,0,0]\n\nRow 2, col 0,2,4: [0,2,0] — input row 2: col 0:0, col 2:2, col 4:0 → [0,2,0]\n\nRow 4, col 0,2,4: [6,0,6] — input row 4: col 0:6, col 2:0, col 4:6 → [6,0,6]\n\nOutput is [[1,0,0],[0,2,0],[6,0,6]], which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is: for a 6x6 input grid, identify the set of rows that contain at least one non-zero element, and the set of columns that contain at least one non-zero element. Then, the output is a submatrix formed by these rows and columns, with the rows and columns in their original order (increasing index).\n\nIn all cases, the non-zero rows are 0,2,4, and non-zero columns are 0,2,4, but that might not always be the case. In these examples, it is, but let's see if it generalizes.\n\nIn the inputs, the rows with data are always the even-indexed rows (0,2,4), and similarly for columns, but in Example 2, col 4 has value, col 2 has value, etc., but it's always col 0,2,4 in these examples.\n\nIn the test case, we need to see.\n\nNow, for the test case:\n\nInput: [[3,0,3,0,4,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[7,0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[7,0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nFirst, identify non-zero rows.\n\nRow 0: [3,0,3,0,4,0] — non-zero at col 0,2,4 (values 3,3,4)\n\nRow 1: all zero\n\nRow 2: [7,0,0,0,1,0] — non-zero at col 0 and col 4 (7 and 1)\n\nRow 3: all zero\n\nRow 4: [7,0,0,0,1,0] — non-zero at col 0 and col 4 (7 and 1)\n\nRow 5: all zero\n\nSo non-zero rows: 0,2,4\n\nNow, non-zero columns: which columns have at least one non-zero element?\n\nCol 0: has values in row 0 (3), row 2 (7), row 4 (7) — non-zero\n\nCol 1: all zero in all rows? Row 0 col 1 is 0, row 2 col 1 is 0, etc. — all zero, so not included.\n\nCol 2: row 0 col 2 is 3 (non-zero), row 2 col 2 is 0, row 4 col 2 is 0 — but since it has non-zero in row 0, it should be included.\n\nCol 3: all zero? Row 0 col 3 is 0, row 2 col 3 is 0, row 4 col 3 is 0 — all zero, not included.\n\nCol 4: row 0 col 4 is 4 (non-zero), row 2 col 4 is 1 (non-zero), row 4 col 4 is 1 (non-zero) — non-zero\n\nCol 5: all zero, not included.\n\nSo non-zero columns: col 0, col 2, col 4\n\nNow, the output should be a submatrix with rows 0,2,4 and columns 0,2,4.\n\nSo, for each row in {0,2,4}, take the values at columns 0,2,4.\n\nRow 0: at col 0,2,4: col 0:3, col 2:3, col 4:4 → [3,3,4]\n\nRow 2: at col 0,2,4: col 0:7, col 2:0, col 4:1 → [7,0,1]\n\nRow 4: at col 0,2,4: col 0:7, col 2:0, col 4:1 → [7,0,1]\n\nSo the output should be [[3,3,4],[7,0,1],[7,0,1]]\n\nNow, is this consistent with the training examples? Yes, same pattern.\n\nIn the training examples, the output size is 3x3 because there are 3 non-zero rows and 3 non-zero columns.\n\nSimilarly here, rows 0,2,4 and columns 0,2,4, so 3x3.\n\nNow, for the JSON response.\n\nI need to output in JSON format with:\n\n- \"patternDescription\": clear description of what was learned.\n\n- \"solvingStrategy\": step-by-step reasoning, including the predicted output grid.\n\n- \"hints\": key reasoning insights, probably an array of strings.\n\n- \"confidence\": confidence score between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, pattern description: From the training examples, the transformation identifies the rows and columns that contain at least one non-zero element. Then, it extracts the submatrix formed by these rows and columns, preserving the original order of indices.\n\nSolving strategy: For the test case, I identified non-zero rows as 0, 2, 4 and non-zero columns as 0, 2, 4. Then, I took the values at the intersections: for row 0, columns 0,2,4: [3,3,4]; row 2: [7,0,1]; row 4: [7,0,1]. So predicted output is [[3,3,4],[7,0,1],[7,0,1]].\n\nHints: I need to list key insights. For example:\n\n- Identify rows with non-zero elements.\n\n- Identify columns with non-zero elements.\n\n- Extract the submatrix from these rows and columns.\n\nConfidence: I'm very sure because the pattern is consistent across all training examples, and the test case fits perfectly. So confidence high, say 100.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any trick.\n\nIn the inputs, all have rows 1,3,5 as all zeros, and similarly columns might have zeros, but we only include columns with at least one non-zero.\n\nIn test case, col 2 has a non-zero in row 0 (value 3), so it should be included, even though in other rows it's zero.\n\nSimilarly in Example 2, col 4 has value only in row 0, but included.\n\nIn Example 3, col 2 has value only in row 2, included.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAlso, the output is always a square or rectangular grid based on the number of non-zero rows and columns.\n\nIn this case, it's 3x3.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow for the JSON.\n\nI need to output only JSON, no other text.\n\nSo, construct the JSON.\n\nFirst, patternDescription: \"The transformation identifies all rows and all columns that contain at least one non-zero element. The output is a submatrix formed by these rows and columns, with values taken from the original grid at the corresponding positions, and rows and columns ordered by their original indices.\"\n\nSolvingStrategy: \"Step 1: For the input grid, find the set of rows with non-zero elements. Here, rows 0, 2, and 4 have non-zero values. Step 2: Find the set of columns with non-zero elements. Here, columns 0, 2, and 4 have non-zero values. Step 3: Extract the values from the intersections of these rows and columns. For row 0, columns 0,2,4: values are 3, 3, 4. For row 2, columns 0,2,4: values are 7, 0, 1. For row 4, columns 0,2,4: values are 7, 0, 1. Thus, the predicted output grid is [[3,3,4], [7,0,1], [7,0,1]].\"\n\nHints: an array of strings. Perhaps: [\"Identify rows containing non-zero elements\", \"Identify columns containing non-zero elements\", \"Form submatrix from these rows and columns\"]\n\nConfidence: 100\n\nNow, write the JSON.\n\nMake sure it's valid JSON.\n\nAlso, in the solvingStrategy, I need to include the predicted output as a 2D array.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n\n\"patternDescription\": \"The pattern involves identifying the rows and columns that have at least one non-zero element in the input grid. The output is a smaller grid formed by taking the values from the intersections of these rows and columns, preserving the original order of indices.\",\n\n\"solvingStrategy\": \"First, I examined the input grid to find which rows contain non-zero elements. Rows 0, 2, and 4 have non-zero values. Next, I found which columns contain non-zero elements. Columns 0, 2, and 4 have non-zero values. Then, I extracted the submatrix by taking the values at the positions where these rows and columns intersect. Specifically, for row 0 and columns 0,2,4: the values are 3, 3, and 4. For row 2 and columns 0,2,4: the values are 7, 0, and 1. For row 4 and columns 0,2,4: the values are 7, 0, and 1. Therefore, the predicted output is a 3x3 grid: [[3,3,4], [7,0,1], [7,0,1]].\",\n\n\"hints\": [\n\n\"Determine the set of rows with at least one non-zero element\",\n\n\"Determine the set of columns with at least one non-zero element\",\n\n\"Construct the output grid from the values at the intersections of these rows and columns\"\n\n],\n\n\"confidence\": 100\n\n}\n\nI think that's good.\n\nConfidence is high because the pattern is clear and consistent.",
