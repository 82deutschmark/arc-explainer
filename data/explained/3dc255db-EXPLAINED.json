        "The top cluster has an enclosed secondary object (color 4). The shortest path to an edge is upwards. The number of internal cells is 3, but the distance to the edge is 2. Thus, a line of two cells of color 4 should be added at the top. However, a more refined rule considering blocked paths was needed.",
        "The top cluster's cavity is open left and right. The rightward path is blocked by an unrelated cell (color 2 at (3,10)). Therefore, the extrusion must go left. The count is 3, distance to edge is >3, so 3 cells are added.",
        "The bottom cluster has secondary colors (7, 2, 8) in cavities that are open to the bottom edge of the grid.",
        "Based on the logic that an extrusion's length is limited by distance to the edge, and the distance to an adjacent edge is 0, no new cells should be added for the bottom cluster. The secondary colors are simply removed.",

An internal cell is one located within a cavity or hole of the main object.\n4. Identify the 'natural opening' of the cavity. This is the direction (up, down, left, or right) through which the cavity opens to the outside of the object.\n5. If the cavity is open directly to a grid edge, no new cells are added.\n6. Otherwise, 'extrude' the internal secondary cells out through this opening. Draw a line of the secondary color starting from the object's boundary, moving towards the nearest grid edge in the opening's direction.\n7. The length of this new line is the minimum of two values: the count of internal secondary cells, and the distance from the object's boundary to the grid edge.\n8.

The secondary objects are removed from their positions inside the main objects. Then, a number of cells corresponding to the removed internal secondary objects are 'extruded' out from the main object through the most natural opening of the cavity they occupied.

Find the natural opening of the cavity. If the opening is not on a grid edge, draw a line of the secondary color outwards from that opening.
