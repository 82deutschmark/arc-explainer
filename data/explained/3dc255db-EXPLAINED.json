The main idea is to identify the \\\"minor color\\\" and slide it to an empty spot to form a straight bar next to its partner color cluster. But I'm struggling! Maybe I could swap an auxiliary color with zeros in a knight's move, but that doesn't seem right. Time’s running low, so I need to focus on the test input, which shows two distinct areas with mixed colors.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Analyzing color placement**\\n\\nIn the test, the top area has 2s forming a thick horizontal bar across rows 3 and 5, with row 4 holding 4s that might be intruding in the 2 region. I think I could move the 4s to the top as vertical pieces in column 8, similar to how 7s were moved up in Example 3. I'll aim to fill the old 4 cells with 2s. It’s tricky: should I replace the 4s in row 4 with 0s or 2s?\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Considering color movements**\\n\\nIn the bottom area, I see colors 9, 8, 7, and 2. Perhaps the 8s could move upwards in column 11, since they're in rows 8 to 12. Previous outputs moved the minor color up to create vertical lines. I could stack the 8s at the top of column 11, but I'm not totally sure. I’ll try to move the minority color in each mixed group to form a vertical stack and replace their original cells with the majority color, like replacing some cells in row 4 with 2s for a more uniform area.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Evaluating color placement**\\n\\nIn the bottom group with colors 9, 8, 7, and 2, I’m considering moving the minority color, which is 8 — I see four 8s in positions (8,10), (9,12), (10,12), and (12,11). I could stack them vertically in column 11, rows 1-4, although the top area already has 4s at column 8. The examples I've seen typically move one color per group, but some moved two, so I think moving both 8s and 7s is possible. The counts for 7 are a bit confusing, so I’ll double-check those positions.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Formulating the final grid**\\n\\nIn the bottom group with 9, 8, 7, and 2, I'm considering how to move the 7s as well. Looking at Example 3, the 7s appear at rows 1-3 but all else is removed. The output also shows symmetrical 6s forming a plus shape. For the 9s, I find them clustered in rows 6-8, possibly in column 3, and they could be moved up. \\n\\nIt seems I should stack 8s vertically in column 11 and replace their original spots with 0s, while also moving 4s to column 8, but I need to be cautious about overlapping existing numbers. There’s a lot of complexity, and I must ensure I follow through on some basic rules: I'll remove the minority colors and keep things organized consistently. Final adjustments will involve moving 4s and 9s up while leaving others unchanged to figure out a plausible grid.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Analyzing row adjustments**\\n\\nFor row 4, the original values are [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,2,0,0]. After removing the 4s, I’m thinking it might convert those to 0s, while keeping the 2 at column 11. This results in: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. \\n\\nI’m aware that this might not be correct, but I’ll proceed with this output and provide the analysis fields as necessary. It’s tricky to make sure everything aligns as I intend.\"}]",
