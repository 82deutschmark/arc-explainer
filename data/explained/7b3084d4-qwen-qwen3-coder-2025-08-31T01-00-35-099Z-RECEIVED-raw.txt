  "solvingStrategy": "First, I analyzed the training examples to identify the transformation pattern. In each example, the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid, focusing on the most significant connected components of specific colors. The cropping seems to be based on the bounding box that contains all non-zero elements, with some padding or specific inclusion rules. I observed that the output grids contain the main shapes or clusters of colors, excluding isolated pixels or large empty spaces. For the test case, I identified the main clusters of colors 2, 3, 7, and 8, determined their bounding box, and extracted the corresponding subgrid.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Examine training examples to understand the transformation from input to output.",
    "Notice that outputs are cropped versions of inputs, focusing on significant shapes.",
    "Identify the bounding box of all non-zero elements in the training outputs.",
    "Apply the same cropping logic to the test input, focusing on the main clusters of colors.",
    "Determine the bounding box that encompasses the main shapes of colors 2, 3, 7, and 8.",
    "Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box to form the predicted output."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation involves cropping the input grid to a smaller grid that contains the main connected components of non-zero elements. The output grid is the smallest rectangle that includes all significant shapes, excluding isolated pixels and large empty areas.",
  "hints": [
    "1. Find bounding box of all non-zero elements -> Crop grid to that box. 2. Identify main color clusters -> Determine their combined bounding box -> Extract subgrid. 3. Scan for clusters of specific colors (2,3,7,8) -> Find their extents -> Crop accordingly.",
    "1. Let I be input grid. Find min/max row/col where I[r][c] != 0. Crop to those bounds. 2. For each color in {2,3,7,8}, find its bounding box. Merge all boxes. Crop I to merged box. 3. Identify connected components of significant colors. Find bounding rectangle of all components. Extract subgrid.",
