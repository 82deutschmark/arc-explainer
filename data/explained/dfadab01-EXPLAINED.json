Then apply that to the test case.\n\nLooking at the training examples:\n\n- Example 1: Input has numbers like 2, 3, 5, 6, and output has patterns like squares (4s) and circles (1s and 6s). The output seems to be drawing shapes around the input numbers.\n\n- Example 2: Similar thing. Input has numbers 1,2,3, and output has squares and circles.\n\n- Example 3: Input has 4s and 2s, output has squares.\n\n- Example 4: This one is more complex with multiple numbers, and output has intricate patterns.\n\nI need to find a common pattern. From all examples, it seems that the input numbers correspond to specific shapes or patterns that are drawn in the output. But the output isn't just drawing the shape at the input location; it's more about relationships between points.\n\nLet me list the input numbers and what they might represent:\n\nIn example 1, input has 2,3,5,6. Output has squares (4) and circles (1 and 6). But 6 is in both input and output, so it might be a color or shape code.\n\nPerhaps the numbers represent types of shapes or operations.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the input has pairs of points or something. Notice that in the input, there are cells with numbers, and in the output, there are shapes centered around those points or between points.\n\nLet's look at the positions. In example 1 input, there are 2s at (1,8), (1,13), (6,8), (6,13) – let's index from 0. Rows and columns from 0 to 19.\n\nInput grid 20x20.\n\nIn output, for example 1, there are squares around these points? But not exactly.\n\nAt (1,8) input has 2, output has a square from row 1 col 8 to 4 col 17? Let's see output: from row 1, col 8 to 12 or something.\n\nPerhaps the numbers indicate that a shape should be drawn, and the value determines the shape.\n\nBut in example 4, there are many numbers, and output has multiple shapes.\n\nAnother thought: from example 2, input has 3 at (1,1), 2 at (1,5), and 3 at (5,5), and 1 at (5,6),(5,7), etc. Output has a square around the 2 and 3? Not sure.\n\nIn example 2 output, there is a square at the top left around (1,1)? But (1,1) has 3, and output has a circle pattern? Output has 1s and 4s.\n\nLet's list the shapes: from examples, 4 seems to represent a square, like a 2x2 block of 4s with a hole, so a square outline. Similarly, 1 seems to represent a circle or diamond pattern, like in example 1 output, the 1s are arranged in a circle pattern.\n\nIn example 1 output, at the bottom, there are patterns with 1s that look like circles: for example, rows 11-14, cols 3-5 have a circle pattern with 1s.\n\nBut what triggers these shapes?\n\nPerhaps the input numbers are points, and between pairs of points, a shape is drawn based on the values.\n\nIn example 1, input has 2s and 3s and 5s and 6s. Notice that 6 is in input and output, so maybe 6 is a shape itself.\n\nLet's see the values: in input, numbers are 0,2,3,5,6,8. In output, numbers are 0,1,4,6,7,8? Example 4 output has 1,4,6,7.\n\nSo output has 1,4,6,7, and input has 2,3,5,6,8.\n\nNot direct mapping.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the input numbers are identifiers for points, and the output draws shapes between points that have the same value or something.\n\nIn example 1, input has multiple 2s, multiple 3s, etc.\n\nLet's list all non-zero points in example 1 input:\n\n- 6 at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) – that's a 2x2 block of 6s.\n\n- 2 at (1,8), (1,13), (6,8), (6,13)\n\n- 3 at (11,2), (16,2), (16,8), (16,13)\n\n- 5 at (5,5), (11,8), (11,13)\n\nIn output, for the 2s, there are squares around them? But the squares are at different positions.\n\nIn output, there are squares at rows 1-4 cols 8-17? Let's see: from row 1 col 8 to row 4 col 17, but it's not continuous; it's multiple squares.\n\nIn output, there is a square from row 1 col 8 to row 4 col 12? Let's see the values.\n\nPerhaps for each pair of points with the same value, a shape is drawn between them.\n\nIn example 1, for value 2, points at (1,8), (1,13), (6,8), (6,13). So pairs like (1,8) and (1,13), but they are horizontally aligned, and in output, there are squares between them? But the squares are vertical.\n\nLet's look at the output squares: for example, the first square is from row 1 col 8 to row 4 col 11? Col 8 to 11 is 4 columns, but the square is 4x4 with outline.\n\nIn output, at row 1, col 8 to 11: values 4,4,4,4 but it's a row, so for square, it has multiple rows.\n\nFrom output: row 1 col 8 to 11: 4,4,4,4 but actually, it's not all 4s; let's read the output array carefully.\n\nExample 1 output: \nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] so at col 8,9,10,11: 4,4,4,4 but then col 12:0, col 13:4, etc. So it's two squares: one from col 8-11 and one from col 13-16, but they are on the same row? No, the square has multiple rows.\n\nFor the square, it has rows 1 to 4 for cols 8-11 and 13-16? Let's see row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0] so at col 8:4, col9:0, col10:0, col11:4, so it's a square outline: for cols 8-11, rows 1-4, the corners are 4s and inside is 0, so it's a hollow square.\n\nSimilarly for cols 13-16, same thing.\n\nAnd these squares are at the same rows, so for the points with value 2, which are at row 1 col8, row1 col13, row6 col8, row6 col13, but the squares are at rows 1-4, which includes row1 but not row6, so not directly on the points.\n\nPerhaps the squares are drawn between the points vertically or horizontally.\n\nNotice that the points with value 2 are at (1,8), (1,13), (6,8), (6,13). So there are two pairs horizontally: (1,8) and (1,13) are on row 1, and (6,8) and (6,13) on row 6. But in output, the squares are at row 1-4, which is above row 1? Row 1 is included, so for the points on row 1, the square is drawn above or below? Row 1-4 includes row 1, so for point at (1,8), the square is centered around it? But the square is from row 1 to 4, so it starts at row 1, so for point at row 1, the square is below it? But row 1 to 4 means rows 1,2,3,4, so point at row 1 is on the top row of the square.\n\nSimilarly, for point at row 6, but in output, there are squares at row 6-9? Let's see output: from row 6, col 8 to 11 and 13-16 have squares? Row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,0,0] so yes, at row 6 col 8-11:4,4,4,4 and row 7 col8:4, col9:0, etc., so another set of squares from row 6 to 9 for cols 8-11 and 13-16.\n\nSo for each point with value 2, there is a square drawn, but the squares are grouped together because the points are close.\n\nBut the points are at row 1 and row 6, so squares at row 1-4 and row 6-9, so the square is drawn with the point on the top row if the point is on the top, or something.\n\nBut let's see the value: value 2 might indicate that a square should be drawn, and the position of the point determines where the square is drawn.\n\nIn example 1, for value 2 points, squares are drawn with the point on the top row of the square.\n\nSimilarly, for value 3 points, in input, value 3 at (11,2), (16,2), (16,8), (16,13). In output, for value 3, there are circle patterns drawn. In output, at rows 11-14, cols 3-5, there is a circle pattern with 1s, and at rows 16-19, cols 3-5, and also at cols 8-11 and 13-16 for rows 16-19? Let's see output.\n\nFrom output: at row 11-14, cols 3-5: there is a pattern like:\nrow11: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0] so cols 3 and 4 have 1,1? col3:1, col4:1, col5:0? row11 col3:0 from array? Let's list row11: index from 0, so col0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:1, col4:1, col5:0, etc. But from pattern, it's a circle: typically a circle pattern has points like row11 col3:1, col4:1, but for circle, it should be like a diamond shape.\n\nIn row11: col3:1, col4:1, but in row12: col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1? From output row12: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0] so col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1, so it's like a plus sign or diamond? row13: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0] col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1, same as row12? row12 col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1, row13 same, row14: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0] col3:1, col4:1, col5:0, so it's a pattern like:\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nbut with holes, so it's a circle outline? No, for a circle, it should be something like:\n  1\n1   1\n1   1\n  1\nso in this case, for rows 11-14, cols 2-5, we have:\nrow11: col3:1, col4:1  -> but col2:0, col5:0, so not that.\nActually, from row11: col3:1, col4:1\nrow12: col2:1, col5:1\nrow13: col2:1, col5:1\nrow14: col3:1, col4:1\nSo it's a diamond shape: the points are at the corners of a diamond, so it's a circle pattern represented by 1s.\n\nSimilarly for other areas.\n\nSo for value 3 points, a circle pattern is drawn with the point on the center or on a corner? In input, value 3 points are at (11,2), which is row11 col2, and in output, the circle pattern is at rows 11-14 cols 2-5, so the point (11,2) is on the top-left of the circle pattern? row11 col2 is 0 in output? row11 col2 is 0, but the circle pattern has points at row11 col3 and col4, so not directly on the point.\n\nPerhaps for each point, a shape is drawn, and the shape is offset based on the value or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the input numbers represent the size or type of shape, and the position is where it is drawn, but from example 1, for value 2, squares are drawn, for value 3, circles are drawn, for value 5, what? value 5 at (5,5), and in output, there is no obvious shape at that position, but in output, there are squares and circles elsewhere.\n\nIn example 1 input, value 5 at (5,5), and in output, at row 5, it's all 0, so no shape there.\n\nBut value 6 in input at (1,1) etc., and in output, there are 6s in the output, so value 6 might be a shape itself or something.\n\nLet's look at example 2 for clarity.\n\nExample 2 input: 10x10 grid.\nInput points:\n- (1,1):3\n- (1,5):2\n- (5,0):2? row5 col0:2 from input: [0,2,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,0] so row5 col0:0? Let's list rows and columns from 0.\n\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0] so at (1,1):3, (1,5):2\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,2,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,0] so (5,1):2, (5,5):3, (5,6):1, (5,7):1\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0] so (6,5):1, (6,8):1\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0] so (7,5):1, (7,8):1\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0] so (8,6):1, (8,7):1\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3] so (9,9):3\n\nOutput: \nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,0,1,1,0,4,4,4,4,0] so at (1,1) now 0, but has circle pattern around? (1,2):1, (1,3):1, etc.\nRow2: [0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,4,0]\nRow3: [0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,4,0]\nRow4: [0,0,1,1,0,4,4,4,4,0]\nRow5: [0,4,4,4,4,0,1,1,0,0]\nRow6: [0,4,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,0]\nRow7: [0,4,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,0]\nRow8: [0,4,4,4,4,0,1,1,0,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo in output, there is a circle pattern at top left around (1,1)? But (1,1) is where input has 3, and circle pattern is with 1s, so for value 3, circle pattern is drawn.\n\nSimilarly, there is a square pattern at (1,5) where input has 2, and output has square with 4s around (1,5)? Let's see: square from row1 col5 to row4 col8? row1 col5:4, col6:4, col7:4, col8:4, but it's a square outline? row2 col5:4, col6:0, col7:0, col8:4, so yes, hollow square.\n\nAlso, at bottom right, there is a circle pattern around (5,5) or (9,9)? input has (5,5):3, and output has circle pattern at row5 col6 to row8 col8? row5 col6:1, col7:1, but it's part of the pattern. Actually, from output, there is a circle pattern at rows 5-8 cols 5-8? row5 col5:0, col6:1, col7:1, col8:0, row6 col5:1, col6:0, col7:0, col8:1, etc., so circle pattern centered around (6.5,6.5) or something.\n\nBut input has value 3 at (5,5), so circle pattern is drawn for value 3.\n\nSimilarly, value 2 at (5,1), and output has square pattern at rows 5-8 cols 1-4? row5 col1:4, col2:4, col3:4, col4:4, but row5 col1:4 from output? row5: [0,4,4,4,4,0,1,1,0,0] so col1:4, col2:4, col3:4, col4:4, and row6 col1:4, col2:0, col3:0, col4:4, etc., so square pattern for value 2.\n\nAlso, input has value 1 at several points, but in output, there are circle patterns for value 1? But in output, the circle patterns are with 1s, so perhaps value 1 in input indicates that a circle pattern should be drawn, but in example 2, input has value 1 at (5,6),(5,7),(6,5),(7,5),(6,8),(7,8),(8,6),(8,7), and these points are exactly where the circle pattern is drawn in output? Let's see: output circle pattern at rows 5-8 cols 5-8, which includes these points, so for value 1, the points are part of the circle pattern, so perhaps value 1 means that the point is on the circle pattern, so when value 1 points are present, a circle pattern is drawn around them.\n\nSimilarly, for value 2 and 3, shapes are drawn at their location.\n\nBut in example 1, value 1 is not in input, but circle patterns are drawn for value 3.\n\nIn example 1, value 3 points have circle patterns drawn around them.\n\nIn example 2, value 3 points have circle patterns drawn around them.\n\nSo perhaps the value determines the type of shape: value 2 means square, value 3 means circle, value 5 means something else, value 6 means something else.\n\nIn example 1, value 5 at (5,5), but in output, no shape there, so maybe value 5 does not draw a shape, or it draws something else.\n\nIn example 1 output, there are also 6s, which are from input value 6, so value 6 might be a shape itself.\n\nIn example 1 input, value 6 at (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2), which is a block, and in output, there are 6s at various places, but not at that block; in output, the block is gone, and 6s are elsewhere.\n\nIn output, at rows 11-14, there are 6s, for example row11 col8:6, col9:6, etc.\n\nSo perhaps for value 6, it doesn't draw a shape but is used in other shapes.\n\nAnother thought: from example 4, it seems that between points of certain values, shapes are drawn, and the shapes are composed of other values.\n\nLet's think about the transformation pattern from all examples.\n\nI recall that in ARC puzzles, sometimes the input numbers are coordinates or indices for drawing shapes.\n\nPerhaps the input numbers are not the values but the positions where shapes are drawn, and the number itself indicates the shape size or type.\n\nBut let's list the input values and output shapes from examples.\n\nFrom example 1:\n- Input value 2: output has square patterns (4s)\n- Input value 3: output has circle patterns (1s)\n- Input value 5: no output shape? But value 5 points are at (5,5), (11,8), (11,13), and in output, at (11,8) and (11,13), there are 6s in the output, so maybe value 5 is related to 6s.\n- Input value 6: output has 6s, but not at the input position.\n\nFrom example 2:\n- Input value 2: output has square patterns\n- Input value 3: output has circle patterns\n- Input value 1: output has circle patterns, but value 1 is used in the circle pattern, so perhaps value 1 means that the point is on a circle, so for value 1, it doesn't draw a shape but is part of a shape drawn for other values.\n\nIn example 2, the circle patterns are drawn for value 3 points, and the value 1 points are within those patterns.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, for value 3 points, circle patterns are drawn, and there are value 5 points within or near them.\n\nIn example 1, value 5 points are at (5,5), which is alone, and no shape, but at (11,8) and (11,13), which are within the circle patterns for value 3? value 3 points are at (11,2), (16,2), etc., so (11,8) is not value 3, but in output, at (11,8), there is 6, and it is within the circle pattern area? Let's see output for example 1: at row11, col8:6, and the circle pattern is at cols 3-5 for rows 11-14, so col8 is not in that circle pattern; there is another area with 6s.\n\nIn output, there are 6s at row11 col8-9:6,6, and row12 col8-9:6,6, and also at col13-14:6,6 for some rows, so perhaps for value 5, it draws 6s or something.\n\nBut let's look at example 3 for better understanding.\n\nExample 3 input: 10x10 grid.\nInput: \nRow0: [4,4,4,4,0,0,2,0,0,0]\nRow1: [4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow2: [4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow3: [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0]\nRow7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput:\nRow0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4]\nRow1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4]\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4]\nRow3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4]\nRow4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow6: [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4]\nRow7: [4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4]\nRow8: [4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4]\nRow9: [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4]\n\nSo in input, there is a square of 4s at top left, and value 2 at (0,6), (4,4), (6,0), (6,6). In output, there are squares at the right side and at bottom left and bottom right.\n\nNotice that the input has a square of 4s, which is already a shape, but in output, it is moved or something? In output, the square from input is gone, and new squares are drawn at positions related to the value 2 points.\n\nFor value 2 points, squares are drawn in the output.\n\nIn this case, value 2 at (0,6), and in output, a square is drawn at cols 6-9, rows 0-3, so around (0,6).\n\nSimilarly, value 2 at (4,4), but in output, no square at (4,4), so perhaps only if the point is on the edge or something.\n\nValue 2 at (6,0), and in output, a square is drawn at rows 6-9, cols 0-3.\n\nValue 2 at (6,6), and in output, a square is drawn at rows 6-9, cols 6-9.\n\nSo for each value 2 point, a square is drawn with the point at the top-left corner of the square? Let's see: for (0,6), the square is from row0-3 col6-9, so (0,6) is the top-left corner of the square.\n\nSimilarly for (6,0), square from row6-9 col0-3, so (6,0) is top-left corner.\n\nFor (6,6), square from row6-9 col6-9, so (6,6) is top-left corner.\n\nFor (4,4), no square, because perhaps it is not on the edge or something, but in output, there is no square at (4,4), so maybe only value 2 points that are not within another shape or something.\n\nIn input, there is a square at top left, which might be value 4, but value 4 is the shape itself, so perhaps value 4 points are not used for drawing shapes; they are already shapes.\n\nIn example 3, the input square of 4s is not present in output; instead, squares are drawn for value 2 points.\n\nSo in general, for value 2 points, a square is drawn with the point at the top-left corner.\n\nSimilarly, from example 2, for value 2 points, squares are drawn. In example 2, value 2 at (1,5) and (5,1). For (1,5), in output, square from row1-4 col5-8? row1 col5:4, col6:4, col7:4, col8:4, row2 col5:4, col6:0, etc., so square from row1 to4 col5 to8, so (1,5) is top-left corner.\n\nSimilarly for (5,1), square from row5-8 col1-4, so (5,1) is top-left corner.\n\nNow for value 3 points, from example 1 and 2, circle patterns are drawn.\n\nIn example 1, value 3 at (11,2), and in output, circle pattern at rows 11-14 cols 2-5, so the point (11,2) is at the top-left of the circle pattern? Let's see the circle pattern: the circle pattern has points at (11,3),(11,4), (12,2),(12,5), (13,2),(13,5), (14,3),(14,4), so the bounding box is from row11 to14 col2 to5, so (11,2) is the top-left corner of the bounding box.\n\nSimilarly for (16,2), circle pattern at rows 16-19 cols 2-5, so (16,2) is top-left corner.\n\nFor (16,8), circle pattern at rows 16-19 cols 8-11? From output, at rows 16-19, there are circle patterns at cols 3-5 and cols 8-11 and cols 13-16? Let's see output example 1.\n\nOutput example 1, for value 3 at (16,8), and (16,13), so for (16,8), circle pattern at rows 16-19 cols 8-11? From output row16: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] so col8:0, col9:1, col10:1, col11:0, so not at col8-11; let's find the circle pattern.\n\nFrom output, at rows 16-19, there are circle patterns: for example, at cols 3-5: row16 col3:1, col4:1, col5:0? row16: col3:1, col4:1, col5:0, but from earlier, for circle pattern, it should have points at corners.\n\nRow16: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] so col3:1, col4:1, col8:0, col9:1, col10:1, col11:0, col14:1, col15:1, so there are circle patterns at cols 3-4, cols 9-10, cols 14-15? But rows need to be considered.\n\nRow17: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] so col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1, col8:1, col9:0, col10:0, col11:1, col13:1, col14:0, col15:0, col16:1, so for each group, it's a circle pattern: for example, around cols 2-5, points at (17,2), (17,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly row18: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] same as row17.\n\nRow19: [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0] so for the circle pattern, the bounding box for one circle is from row16 to19 col2 to5? col2 to5 includes col2,3,4,5.\n\nFrom row16, col2:0, col3:1, col4:1, col5:0\nRow17, col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1\nRow18, col2:1, col3:0, col4:0, col5:1\nRow19, col2:0, col3:1, col4:1, col5:0\nSo the circle pattern has points at (17,2), (17,5), (18,2), (18,5), and (16,3),(16,4),(19,3),(19,4), so the bounding box is from row16 to19 col2 to5, so for value 3 at (16,2), which is row16 col2, it is the top-left corner of the bounding box.\n\nSimilarly for value 3 at (16,8), which is row16 col8, and there is a circle pattern at cols 8-11? From row16 col8:0, col9:1, col10:1, col11:0, row17 col8:1, col9:0, col10:0, col11:1, etc., so bounding box row16-19 col8-11, so (16,8) is top-left corner.\n\nSimilarly for (16,13), circle pattern at cols 13-16, so (16,13) is top-left corner.\n\nSo for value 3 points, a circle pattern is drawn with the point at the top-left corner of the bounding box.\n\nNow for value 1 points, from example 2, value 1 points are on the circle pattern, so perhaps value 1 points are not used for drawing shapes but are part of the circle pattern drawn for value 3.\n\nIn example 1, there are value 5 points, and in output, there are 6s, but let's see where.\n\nIn example 1 input, value 5 at (5,5), (11,8), (11,13). In output, for (5,5), no output, but for (11,8), in output, there are 6s at around that area? From output, at row11 col8:6, col9:",
