      "patternDescription": "The aliens are adding a border around each set of symbols, matching the first and last symbols of each row to the border, and filling in the middle with the original pattern.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the numbers as emojis: 0 is ‚¨õ, 1 is ‚úÖ, 2 is üëΩ, 3 is üë§, and 4 is ü™ê. Look at each row of numbers: the aliens take the first number of the row and put it at the very start as a border, then keep the original pattern in the middle, then put the same first number at the end as a border. Repeat this for each row, but for the last row, they do the same with the last number in that row. To solve the puzzle, you can convert the numbers to emojis, observe this border pattern, and then recreate it with the emojis. Essentially, they are 'framing' each row with the same symbol at both ends, and keeping the middle the same.",
      "hints": [
        "Focus on the first and last numbers of each row.",
        "Notice how each row gets a border of the same symbol on both sides.",
        "The middle of each row remains unchanged; only borders are added."

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to tell us that their message is about boundaries or borders‚Äîperhaps emphasizing what's inside versus outside. They could be showing that their communication is about framing or enclosing certain ideas or objects. There‚Äôs no hostility here; it seems more like a way to highlight or protect important parts of their message‚Äîlike drawing a frame around what matters.",
