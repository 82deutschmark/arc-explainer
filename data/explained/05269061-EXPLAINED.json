To solve the puzzle, you imagine moving or copying the key parts of the pattern so that they repeat in a regular, predictable way across the whole grid. It’s like creating a wallpaper pattern by repeating a small design. To understand it as emojis, think of selecting a small group of emojis and copying it in a pattern to fill the whole picture.",

        "Look for the small group of symbols that appear in the initial grid.",
