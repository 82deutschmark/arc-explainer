      "solvingStrategy": "Examine training pairs: each 3x3 input is expanded to a 9x9 output composed of nine 3x3 blocks arranged same relative positions. The value in each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block filled with that value in the corresponding quadrant of the output, but blocks are permuted: Observe Example1 input positions and output blocks: Input [0,0] value 3 becomes top-left 3x3 block filled 3. Input [0,1]=0 becomes top-center block filled 0. Input [0,2]=2 becomes top-right block filled 2. Middle row input [1,0]=0 maps to middle-left block filled 0 but in examples the center and right blocks show more complex mapping: Actually pattern is straightforward: each input cell expands to a 3x3 block placed at (row*3 .. row*3+2, col*3 .. col*3+2) filled with that cell's value. Confirm with Example2 where input[1,0]=7 yields center-left 3x3 block of 7s, etc. Thus for test input, construct 9x9 by replacing each input cell with 3x3 block of that value at corresponding location. Input grid: row0: [0,1,0] -> top-left 3x3 zeros, top-center 3x3 ones, top-right 3x3 zeros. row1: [0,0,6] -> middle-left zeros, middle-center zeros, middle-right 6s. row2: [6,1,0] -> bottom-left 6s, bottom-center 1s, bottom-right zeros. However note from training examples that zeros in input nonetheless produce blocks of possibly nonzero in outputs? Reviewing examples shows zeros remain zeros. So apply expansion to produce final 9x9 grid with blocks as described. I generated the matrix accordingly.",
