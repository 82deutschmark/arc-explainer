    "solvingStrategy": "I analyzed all three training examples to identify the pattern. Each example shows a large input grid with various colored shapes (represented by numbers) and a smaller output grid. The key insight is that the output represents the 'core pattern' of the most prominent shape in the input, extracted in a specific way. In Example 1, the output shows the pattern of the '2' shape (which appears as a cross pattern). In Example 2, the output shows pairs of numbers representing the sequence of shapes from the center outward. In Example 3, the output shows the repeating pattern of the '7' shape (which is a 3x3 pattern with a specific arrangement). For the test cases, I identified the most prominent shapes (4 in Test 1, 3 and 2 in Test 2) and extracted their core patterns following the same logic as the training examples.",

      "Examined Example 1: Input has shapes 1,2,4,5. Output shows the pattern of shape 2 (which appears as a cross: [[2,2,2],[2,0,2],[2,2,2]] but compressed to [[2,2,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0],[2,2,2]] - actually looking closer it's extracting the fundamental unit pattern)",
      "Examined Example 2: Input has shapes 4,8,9. Output shows pairs of numbers representing the sequence from center to edge: [9,9], [8,9], [8,8], etc.",
      "Examined Example 3: Input has shapes 2,3,7. Output shows the repeating 3x3 pattern of shape 7: [[7,7,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,7]] repeated multiple times",
      "For Test 1: The most prominent shape is 4 (appears in multiple places). The shape 4 appears as a diamond pattern. Following Example 3 pattern, I need to extract the core 3x3 pattern of shape 4 and repeat it",
      "For Test 2: There are two prominent shapes: 3 (square) and 2 (another shape). Following Example 2 pattern, I need to extract the sequence of these shapes from the center",
      "The 3 shape appears as a 5x5 square pattern: [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,0,0,0,3],[3,0,0,0,3],[3,0,0,0,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]",
      "The 2 shape appears as another 5x5 pattern: [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,0,0,2],[2,0,0,0,2],[2,0,0,0,2],[2,2,2,2,2]]",
      "Following Example 2 logic, the output should show these patterns in sequence"

    "patternDescription": "The transformation extracts the core pattern of the most prominent shape(s) in the input. For solid shapes (like in Examples 1 and 3), it extracts the fundamental unit pattern and repeats it. For concentric patterns (like Example 2), it extracts the sequence of shapes from center to edge. The output represents the 'essence' of the shape pattern found in the input.",
