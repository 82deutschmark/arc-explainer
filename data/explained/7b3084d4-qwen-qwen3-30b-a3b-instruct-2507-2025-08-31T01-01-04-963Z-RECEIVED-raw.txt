  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves identifying distinct regions of non-zero values (objects) in the input grid and extracting or transforming them into a new output grid. The key insight is that the output is not a direct transformation of the entire input but rather a structured combination of the most prominent non-zero patterns, particularly focusing on horizontal or vertical blocks of the same number. The output appears to be a 'compressed' or 'merged' representation of the dominant shapes, especially those that are rectangular or aligned. In each training example, the output grid is smaller and contains only the non-zero values from the input, arranged in a way that preserves their relative positions and shapes. The pattern suggests that the output is formed by extracting the largest connected components (by value) and arranging them in a new grid, possibly by stacking or aligning them based on their spatial layout. In the test case, the dominant patterns are: a large block of 2s (7x7), a block of 3s (7x7), a block of 7s (7x7), and a block of 8s (7x7). The 5 is isolated and appears only once. The output seems to be a vertical stacking of these blocks, with the 5 included in the last row of the 7s block. The output grid is constructed by taking the non-zero rows from the input that contain these blocks and aligning them vertically, preserving their internal structure. The final output is a 18x14 grid, where each row corresponds to a row from the input that contains non-zero values, and only the relevant columns are kept. The 5 is placed in the last row of the 7s block, which matches the input. The 8s block is also extended to include the 8 in the last row. The output is thus a vertical concatenation of the key blocks, with the 5 integrated into the 7s block.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Analyze each training example to identify the transformation pattern.",
    "In Example 1: The output is a 6x6 grid formed by extracting and reorganizing the 9s, 7s, 4s, and 3s regions. The 9s are in the top-left, 7s in the top-right, 4s in the middle, and 3s in the bottom-right. The output appears to be a merged view of these regions, with some overlap and transformation.",
    "In Example 2: The output is a 10x10 grid. The 7s, 2s, 3s, and 6s are extracted and reorganized. The 5 is at the top-left, then 7s, then 2s, then 3s and 6s. The pattern suggests that the output is a combination of the most prominent non-zero regions, arranged in a way that reflects their spatial relationships in the input.",
    "In Example 3: The output is a 4x4 grid. The 2s, 6s, 8s, and 5s are extracted. The 5 is at the top-left, then 7s, then 8s, then 2s. The output seems to be a compact representation of the key shapes, possibly by taking the bounding boxes of the largest connected components.",
    "Apply the same logic to the test case: Identify the dominant non-zero regions: 2s (7x7), 3s (7x7), 7s (7x7), 8s (7x7), and the isolated 5.",
    "Notice that the 2s, 3s, 7s, and 8s are all in large rectangular blocks. The 5 is at the bottom of the 7s block.",
    "The output should be a vertical stacking of these blocks, with the 5 included in the 7s block.",
    "Extract the rows that contain non-zero values and keep only the relevant columns.",
    "Construct the output by stacking the rows of the 2s block, then the 3s block, then the 7s block (with the 5), then the 8s block.",
    "Ensure that the output grid size matches the pattern seen in training examples: the output is smaller and focused on the key shapes.",
    "Verify that the output matches the expected structure: 18 rows, 14 columns, with the 5 in the correct position."

  "patternDescription": "The transformation extracts the largest connected components (by value) from the input grid and arranges them in a new grid by vertically stacking the rows of each component. The components are identified by their value and spatial extent. The output is formed by taking the non-zero rows from the input that contain these components and aligning them vertically, preserving their internal structure. The 5 is treated as part of the 7s block. The output grid size is determined by the number of rows in the input that contain non-zero values, and the columns are determined by the maximum width of the components. The output is a compressed representation of the dominant shapes in the input.",
  "hints": [
    "for each non-zero value in the input, find its connected component; for each component, extract its bounding box; stack the components vertically in the output; place the 5 in the last row of the 7s component.",
    "Let C be the set of connected components; for each c in C, let B(c) be its bounding box; output = stack(B(c) for c in C sorted by top-left corner); if c contains 5, place 5 in the last row of B(c).",
