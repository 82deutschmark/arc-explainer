  "solvingStrategy": "- Observed that outputs introduce color 2 as a mirrored counterpart of existing color-1 pixels across a central vertical axis of the 10x10 grid.\n- The consistent axis across examples is the middle column (index 5 in 0-based indexing). For each row, consider positions in the right half (columns 5..9) that contain 1s. Mirror these positions across the axis to the left side using j' = 10 - j, and color those mirrored cells with 2 provided they are 0 in the input (do not overwrite 1s).\n- Verified on Examples 2 and 3: 2s appear exactly at left-side mirrored coordinates of right-half 1s, excluding overlaps with 1s. Example 1 shows the same mechanism within the rows where right-half 1s extend beyond the axis (resulting left positions that are 0 get 2); rows without such mirrored zeros remain unchanged.\n- For the test, I copied the input and, row by row, mirrored every right-half 1 to its left counterpart, writing 2 if the target cell was 0. If the mirrored position coincided with an existing 1 (e.g., central symmetric rows), I left it unchanged.\n- Produced the final grid accordingly.",

  "patternDescription": "Mirror the right-half (columns 5..9) 1s across the central vertical axis (column 5) onto the left half, marking mirrored positions with color 2, without overwriting existing 1s. This creates a left-side reflection of the right-side structure using color 2.",
