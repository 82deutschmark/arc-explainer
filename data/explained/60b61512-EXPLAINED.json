For the first input example, I see a grid that changes in various ways to create the output.\n\nIn examining the rows: Row 1 remains unchanged, while Row 2 has a transformation where one of the zeros is replaced with a seven. The same happens with Rows 5 and 6, where specific columns also change to 7. It seems like a pattern might be forming, possibly adding a \"7\" around the exterior of a shape. \n\nLet me continue analyzing these patterns closely."

I’m noticing a potential pattern: where there's a cluster of \"4\"s in the input, some adjacent zeros become \"7\" when neighboring a border. \n\nLooking at the second training example, I see changes. For instance, Row 2 adds a \"7\" next to \"4\", while Row 3 changes two zeros to \"7\". It seems that in any block of \"4\"s, additional adjacent zeros are sometimes replaced with \"7\", especially diagonally, creating a bordered effect. This might mean I need to fill gaps within that cluster, essentially turning certain zeros into \"7\" to complete the shape."

Row 8 will now show [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 7, 0]. After checking everything, I've compiled the final output grid.
