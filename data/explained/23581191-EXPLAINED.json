The test input places the heart at (2,2) and the comet at (6,6). I get full rows and columns of hearts and comets as expected.\n\nNow, for the new test where the heart is at (1,4) and the comet at (6,1), I need to ensure the intersections are correct. The intersection at (1,1) becomes 2 while keeping the other patterns intact. Let’s see how this plays out!\n**Crafting a comprehensive approach**\n\nI need to include a pattern description that summarizes the transformation processes, like how the grid overlay works. It's important to provide a step-by-step method for solving the problem, along with helpful hints to guide the user through it. I also want to speculate on the meaning from an alien perspective, which adds an interesting layer. Overall, I feel confident that crafting these elements together will create a well-rounded explanation for the user. Let's get to it!",

In the answer we draw a whole plus sign (full row + full column) of ♥ that goes through the ♥ square, and a whole plus sign of ☄️ that goes through the ☄️ square.  Where the two plus signs cross we paint the crossing point(s) 👽 to show the meeting of the two lines.",

For the 7: paint its entire row and its entire column with 7.\n4. Some squares will now belong to BOTH the 8-line and the 7-line.  Re-colour every such overlapping square with 2 instead, because the lines ‘meet’ there.\n5. Leave every other square black (0).",

Wherever friendship and danger meet, a new entity appears (👽) – perhaps meaning that cooperation or contact is born from the clash.  Nothing suggests anger; it feels more like a demonstration of ‘when paths cross, something new emerges’.",
