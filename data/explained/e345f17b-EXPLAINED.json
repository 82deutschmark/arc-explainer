Hypothesized that the output represents a simplified extraction or transformation based on the arrangement of 6s and 5s, such as their positions or absence in paired columns. Applied this by mimicking the output shapes from similar training examples to the test inputs, as no single consistent rule was fully identified across all examples.",

Attempted to map output 4s to input patterns, such as presence of 6s or 5s in specific columns or rows, but found inconsistencies (e.g., in Example 1, 4s in lower rows; in Example 3, 4s in middle row). 3. Considered incorrect approaches like checking for both 0s in pairs or presence of 6s alone. 4. Concluded that outputs mimic shapes from training, so applied similar 4s placements to test inputs based on visual similarity. 5. For Test 1, based on Example 1's output shape. 6. For Test 2, based on Example 2's output shape.",
      "patternDescription": "The transformation rules appear to involve extracting a 4x4 grid where 4s are placed in positions corresponding to the end or specific arrangements of 6s and 5s in the input, such as in the lower or right sections, but the exact rule is inconsistent across examples, leading to pattern mimicry.",
