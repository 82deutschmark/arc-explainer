      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to find the pattern. All inputs are 5x5 grids with zeros in certain positions, and outputs are 3x3 grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput: [[1,0,0,0,9],[0,5,0,8,0],[0,0,7,0,0],[0,8,0,5,0],[9,0,0,0,1]]\nOutput: [[1,5,9],[8,7,8],[9,5,1]]\n\nThe output seems to be taking elements from the input grid. Specifically, the corners and the center might be involved.\n\nIn the input, the corners are 1, 9, 9, 1 and the center is 7. But the output has more than that.\n\nLet's list the positions:\n\nFor a 5x5 grid, indices from 0 to 4.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Top-left corner: [0][0] = 1\n- Top-right corner: [0][4] = 9\n- Bottom-left corner: [4][0] = 9\n- Bottom-right corner: [4][4] = 1\n- Center: [2][2] = 7\n\nBut the output has 1,5,9 in first row; 8,7,8 in second; 9,5,1 in third.\n\n5 and 8 are from other positions. Let's see where 5 and 8 are in input.\n\nInput row 1: [0,5,0,8,0] so at [1][1] = 5 and [1][3] = 8\nSimilarly, row 3: [0,8,0,5,0] so [3][1] = 8 and [3][3] = 5\n\nIn output, first row has 1,5,9 which are [0][0], [1][1], [0][4]\nSecond row has 8,7,8 which are [1][3], [2][2], [3][1]? [3][1] is 8, but [1][3] is 8, and [2][2] is 7.\n\nOutput second row: 8,7,8 — so positions: [1][3], [2][2], [3][1]? [3][1] is 8, but in output it's the third element, which might be [3][1] or something.\n\nPerhaps it's a pattern where we take the elements from the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal or something.\n\nLet's think of the grid as having a cross pattern.\n\nIn a 5x5 grid, the elements that are not zero are on the two diagonals.\n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero elements are:\n- Main diagonal: [0][0]=1, [1][1]=5, [2][2]=7, [3][3]=5, [4][4]=1\n- Anti-diagonal: [0][4]=9, [1][3]=8, [2][2]=7, [3][1]=8, [4][0]=9\n\nBut [2][2] is shared.\n\nNow the output is 3x3. How is it constructed?\n\nFrom output: [[1,5,9],[8,7,8],[9,5,1]]\n\nCompare to diagonals:\nMain diagonal: 1,5,7,5,1\nAnti-diagonal: 9,8,7,8,9\n\nBut output has three rows and three columns.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last of the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, but not exactly.\n\nMain diagonal: indices 0,1,2,3,4 -> values 1,5,7,5,1\nIf we take first, middle, last: 1,7,1 but output has 1,5,9 in first row, which doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the elements where the diagonals intersect or something.\n\nLet's list the row and column indices.\n\nNotice that in the output, the first row has elements from row 0 and row 4, but not exactly.\n\nFrom Example 1 output:\n- [0][0] of output = 1 = input[0][0]\n- [0][1] of output = 5 = input[1][1]\n- [0][2] of output = 9 = input[0][4]\n- [1][0] of output = 8 = input[1][3]\n- [1][1] of output = 7 = input[2][2]\n- [1][2] of output = 8 = input[3][1]? input[3][1] is 8, but [1][2] of output is 8, which might be input[1][3] or input[3][1], let's see.\n\nIn output, [1][2] is 8, and in input, [1][3] is 8, and [3][1] is 8, but which one?\n\nSimilarly, [2][0] of output = 9 = input[4][0]\n- [2][1] of output = 5 = input[3][3]\n- [2][2] of output = 1 = input[4][4]\n\nSo, for output 3x3 grid, the elements are from input at specific positions.\n\nLet's find the mapping.\n\nFrom Example 1:\nOutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\nOutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\nOutput[0][2] = input[0][4]\nOutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\nOutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\nOutput[1][2] = input[3][1]  // since input[3][1] = 8\nOutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\nOutput[2][1] = input[3][3]\nOutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nNow, let's see the indices:\n\nFor output row i, column j, what is the input row and column?\n\ni and j from 0 to 2.\n\nFrom above:\nWhen i=0, j=0: input row=0, col=0\ni=0, j=1: input row=1, col=1\ni=0, j=2: input row=0, col=4\ni=1, j=0: input row=1, col=3\ni=1, j=1: input row=2, col=2\ni=1, j=2: input row=3, col=1\ni=2, j=0: input row=4, col=0\ni=2, j=1: input row=3, col=3\ni=2, j=2: input row=4, col=4\n\nNow, let's find a pattern in these indices.\n\nNotice that for output[i][j], the input row seems to be related to i and j.\n\nList the input row for each output cell:\ni=0,j=0: row=0\ni=0,j=1: row=1\ni=0,j=2: row=0\ni=1,j=0: row=1\ni=1,j=1: row=2\ni=1,j=2: row=3\ni=2,j=0: row=4\ni=2,j=1: row=3\ni=2,j=2: row=4\n\nSimilarly for columns:\ni=0,j=0: col=0\ni=0,j=1: col=1\ni=0,j=2: col=4\ni=1,j=0: col=3\ni=1,j=1: col=2\ni=1,j=2: col=1\ni=2,j=0: col=0\ni=2,j=1: col=3\ni=2,j=2: col=4\n\nThe row indices: for fixed j, row changes with i, but not linearly.\n\nNotice that the row indices seem symmetric: for j=0, rows are 0,1,4? i=0 row=0, i=1 row=1, i=2 row=4 — not symmetric.\n\nPerhaps it's based on the distance from center or something.\n\nAnother thought: the output might be capturing the elements from the diagonals in a specific order.\n\nFrom the values, in Example 1, output first row: 1,5,9 which are top-left, center-left? No.\n\nLet's list the input positions in order of output.\n\nPerhaps for a 5x5 grid, the output 3x3 is formed by taking the elements at the intersections of the rows and columns that have non-zero elements, but all rows and columns have non-zero in this case.\n\nIn the input, the non-zero elements are on the diagonals, so the rows that have non-zero are all rows, but the values are only on diagonals.\n\nFrom the mapping above, the input row for output[i][j] is: it seems like for each output cell, the row is min or max of i and something.\n\nNotice that for output[i][j], the input row is often i or 4-i, but not always.\n\ni=0, row=0 or 1\ni=1, row=1,2,3\ni=2, row=4 or 3\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nLet's list the row and column separately.\n\nFor row index of input:\nWhen j=0, input row: for i=0:0, i=1:1, i=2:4\nWhen j=1, input row: for i=0:1, i=1:2, i=2:3\nWhen j=2, input row: for i=0:0, i=1:3, i=2:4\n\nSimilarly for column:\nWhen i=0, input col: for j=0:0, j=1:1, j=2:4\nWhen i=1, input col: for j=0:3, j=1:2, j=2:1\nWhen i=2, input col: for j=0:0, j=1:3, j=2:4\n\nFrom this, for input row, it seems like row = something like |i - something| or min/max.\n\nNotice that for output[i][j], the input row is: if j=0 or j=2, it might be related to i and the corner, but for j=1, it's different.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the grid of the values from the diagonals, but arranged in a way that the center is shared.\n\nLet's look at the values themselves.\n\nIn all examples, the output is symmetric in some way.\n\nIn Example 1, output is symmetric around the center: first row 1,5,9 and last row 9,5,1 are mirrors, and middle row 8,7,8 is symmetric.\n\nSimilarly in Example 2: input [[6,0,0,0,7],[0,2,0,4,0],[0,0,3,0,0],[0,4,0,2,0],[7,0,0,0,6]] output [[6,2,7],[4,3,4],[7,2,6]] which is symmetric.\n\nExample 3: input [[2,0,0,0,1],[0,3,0,6,0],[0,0,4,0,0],[0,6,0,3,0],[1,0,0,0,2]] output [[2,3,1],[6,4,6],[1,3,2]] symmetric.\n\nSo the output is always a 3x3 grid that is symmetric around the center.\n\nNow for the test case input: [[7,0,0,0,5],[0,6,0,4,0],[0,0,2,0,0],[0,4,0,6,0],[5,0,0,0,7]] which is also symmetric, so output should be symmetric.\n\nBut how to find the values.\n\nFrom the mapping I had earlier, let's confirm with Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input: [[6,0,0,0,7],[0,2,0,4,0],[0,0,3,0,0],[0,4,0,2,0],[7,0,0,0,6]]\n\nIf I use the same position mapping as from Example 1:\n\nOutput[0][0] = input[0][0] = 6\nOutput[0][1] = input[1][1] = 2\nOutput[0][2] = input[0][4] = 7\nOutput[1][0] = input[1][3] = 4\nOutput[1][1] = input[2][2] = 3\nOutput[1][2] = input[3][1] = 4  // input[3][1] is 4\nOutput[2][0] = input[4][0] = 7\nOutput[2][1] = input[3][3] = 2  // input[3][3] is 2\nOutput[2][2] = input[4][4] = 6\n\nSo output: [[6,2,7],[4,3,4],[7,2,6]] which matches Example 2 output.\n\nSimilarly for Example 3:\nInput: [[2,0,0,0,1],[0,3,0,6,0],[0,0,4,0,0],[0,6,0,3,0],[1,0,0,0,2]]\nOutput[0][0] = input[0][0] = 2\nOutput[0][1] = input[1][1] = 3\nOutput[0][2] = input[0][4] = 1\nOutput[1][0] = input[1][3] = 6\nOutput[1][1] = input[2][2] = 4\nOutput[1][2] = input[3][1] = 6  // input[3][1] is 6\nOutput[2][0] = input[4][0] = 1\nOutput[2][1] = input[3][3] = 3  // input[3][3] is 3\nOutput[2][2] = input[4][4] = 2\n\nWhich gives [[2,3,1],[6,4,6],[1,3,2]] matching output.\n\nSo the pattern is consistent: for a 5x5 input grid, the output 3x3 grid is formed by taking specific elements from the input:\n\n- output[0][0] = input[0][0]\n- output[0][1] = input[1][1]\n- output[0][2] = input[0][4]\n- output[1][0] = input[1][3]\n- output[1][1] = input[2][2]\n- output[1][2] = input[3][1]\n- output[2][0] = input[4][0]\n- output[2][1] = input[3][3]\n- output[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nNow for the test case input: [[7,0,0,0,5],[0,6,0,4,0],[0,0,2,0,0],[0,4,0,6,0],[5,0,0,0,7]]\n\nApply the same mapping:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0] = 7\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1] = 6\noutput[0][2] = input[0][4] = 5\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3] = 4  // input[1][3] is 4\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2] = 2\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1] = 4  // input[3][1] is 4\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0] = 5\noutput[2][1] = input[3][3] = 6  // input[3][3] is 6\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4] = 7\n\nSo the output should be: [[7,6,5],[4,2,4],[5,6,7]]\n\nAnd this is symmetric, as expected.\n\nNow, to confirm, the input has values only on the diagonals, similar to training examples.\n\nSo for the test case, this should be the output.\n\nThe JSON structure: since it's a single test case, I need to set \"multiplePredictedOutputs\": false, and \"predictedOutput\" as the 2D array.\n\nAlso, I need to provide the other fields like solvingStrategy, reasoningItems, etc.\n\nFirst, the predicted output should be the first field.\n\nSo in JSON, I need to output something like:\n\n{\n  \"multiplePredictedOutputs\": false,\n  \"predictedOutput\": [[7,6,5],[4,2,4],[5,6,7]],\n  \"predictedOutput1\": [],\n  \"predictedOutput2\": [],\n  \"predictedOutput3\": [],\n  \"solvingStrategy\": \"...\",\n  \"reasoningItems\": [...],\n  \"patternDescription\": \"...\",\n  \"hints\": \"...\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n\nNow for the analysis fields.\n\nsolvingStrategy: I examined the training examples and found that the output 3x3 grid is constructed by selecting specific elements from the input 5x5 grid based on fixed positions: the corners, the center, and the elements on the diagonals at specific offsets.\n\nreasoningItems: I'll list the steps.\n\n- Step 1: Noticed that all input grids are 5x5 with zeros on off-diagonals, and outputs are 3x3 symmetric grids.\n- Step 2: Compared input and output positions for Example 1, identified the mapping of indices.\n- Step 3: Verified the same mapping works for Examples 2 and 3.\n- Step 4: Applied the mapping to the test case input to derive the output.\n\npatternDescription: The transformation extracts elements from the input grid at positions (0,0), (1,1), (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0), (3,3), (4,4) to form a 3x3 output grid.\n\nhints: I need to describe three pseudo-code algorithms, one as best, one as math, one as emojis.\n\nBest algorithm: For each cell in output 3x3 grid, assign value from input at specific row and column based on pre-defined mapping.\n\nMath algorithm: Let output[i][j] = input[ row_map[i][j] ][ col_map[i][j] ] where row_map and col_map are constant matrices based on the pattern.\n\nEmojis: Perhaps use arrows or something, but since it's pseudo-code, I can describe with emojis like 📍→🔄 for position mapping.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nFor hints, I need to describe three algorithms.\n\nFirst, the best one: Iterate over i and j from 0 to 2, and set output[i][j] to input[ rows[i][j] ][ cols[i][j] ] where rows and cols are constant

better to use text with emojis. Since it's pseudo-code, I can say: for each 🔲 in output, find 🔍 in input at specific 📍.\n\nBut let's make it clear.\n\nhints: [\n  \"Best: For i in 0..2, j in 0..2, output[i][j] = input[ row_index(i,j) ][ col_index(i,j) ] where row_index and col_index are defined by the pattern.\",\n  \"Math: output = [[input[0][0], input[1][1], input[0][4]], [input[1][3], input[2][2], input[3][1]], [input[4][0], input[3][3], input[4][4]]]\",\n  \"Emojis: 🎯→📋 for fixed position mapping from input to output grid.\"\n]\n\nconfidence: 100, since the pattern is consistent across all training examples.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to make sure it's valid JSON.\n\nAlso, predictedOutput1,2,3 should be empty arrays since multiplePredictedOutputs is false.\n\nSo, let's write the JSON.",
