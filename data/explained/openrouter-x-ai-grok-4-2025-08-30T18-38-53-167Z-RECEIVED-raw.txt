  "solvingStrategy": "I analyzed the training examples by comparing inputs and outputs grid by grid. The top row (row 0) contains a pattern of 5's and 0's. Markers (5's) appear in the last column (column 9) of certain rows. In the output, these marked rows are modified: for columns 0-8, place 2 where the top row has 5, and 0 elsewhere; column 9 remains 5. Unmarked rows and the top row remain unchanged. I verified this rule across all three training examples, noting consistencies like color change from 5 to 2 and preservation of the marker. Applied the same to the test input, identifying markers in rows 2,3,5,7,9 and generating the output accordingly.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Step 1: Observed that top row remains unchanged in all outputs.",
    "Step 2: Noted 5's in last column of input indicate rows to modify; initially thought it might be filling blocks between markers, but that didn't match as outputs have isolated rows sometimes.",
    "Step 3: Compared positions: in modified rows, 2's appear exactly where top row has 5's in columns 0-8.",
    "Step 4: Insight: color transformation 5->2, but only in pattern positions; incorrect approach was assuming full row copy, but it's selective.",
    "Step 5: Verified marker in column 9 stays 5, not overwritten.",
    "Step 6: Applied to test: pattern positions 0,2,3,6,8 get 2 in marked rows, others 0, column 9=5."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The top row defines a pattern of positions with color 5. Rows with a 5 in the last column are modified in the output: for columns 0-8, set to 2 if the top row has 5 there, else 0; the last column remains 5. All other rows and the top row are unchanged. This is a pattern replication with color mapping (5 to 2) applied selectively to marked rows.",
  "hints": [
    "function transform(grid): pattern = grid[0]; for row in 1 to 9: if grid[row][9] == 5: for col in 0 to 8: grid[row][col] = 2 if pattern[col] == 5 else 0; // grid[row][9] remains 5; return grid;",
    "Let P be the set of column indices j where grid[0][j] = 5 for j=0..8. For each row i=1..9, if grid[i][9]=5, then grid[i][j] = 2 if j ∈ P else 0 for j=0..8, and grid[i][9]=5.",
