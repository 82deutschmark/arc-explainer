  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed the training examples to identify the transformation pattern, which appears to involve isolating the positions of the '6's and '5's, then replacing the non-zero elements with zeros and marking the positions of the '6's and '5's with specific values. The pattern suggests that the output emphasizes the positions of the '6's and '5's, possibly highlighting or isolating these elements. For the test cases, the pattern indicates that the output should be a grid of zeros, as the specific positions of '6's and '5's are not emphasized or are to be neutralized, resulting in a grid filled with zeros.",

    "Identified that the pattern involves focusing on the positions of '6's and '5's and transforming the grid accordingly.",
