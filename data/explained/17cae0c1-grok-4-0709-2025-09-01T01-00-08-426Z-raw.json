  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed the training examples by dividing each 3x9 input grid into three 3x3 blocks. Identified that each unique 3x3 pattern of 5's maps to a specific output color (number 0-9), which is then used to fill the corresponding three columns across all three rows identically. Mapped all patterns from training and applied to test input blocks.",

    "Step 1: Observed that outputs have identical rows and are divided into groups of three identical columns.",

    "Step 4: Noted test input blocks match known patterns: left=bottom full=1, middle=backslash diagonal=9, right=top full=6.",
    "Step 5: Considered if there's a deeper rule like rotation, center of mass, or binary, but mappings fit directly without need for new patterns in test.",

Each block's pattern of 5's (on 0 background) is classified into one of the demonstrated types, mapping to a number (color): \n- All except center 0: 3\n- Center only: 4\n- Backslash diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): 9\n- Bottom row full: 1\n- Top row full: 6\nThe output fills each corresponding 3-column group with the mapped number repeated in every position, making all rows identical.",
