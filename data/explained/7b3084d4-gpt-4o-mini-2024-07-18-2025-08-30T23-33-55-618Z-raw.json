  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation pattern involves identifying clusters of numbers in the input grid and determining how they are represented in the output grid. The key is to observe how the numbers are grouped and how they transition from one form to another across the training examples. The output seems to reflect a combination of the highest numbers in the input clusters, while also considering the presence of zeros and other numbers that might influence the final output.",
  "keySteps": [
    "1. Analyze the training examples to identify how clusters of numbers are transformed into the output.",
    "2. Note the patterns of repetition and grouping in the output grids.",
    "3. Apply the identified patterns to the test case input, focusing on the clusters of 2s and 3s.",
    "4. Ensure that the output grid maintains the structure of the input while reflecting the transformations observed in the training examples."
