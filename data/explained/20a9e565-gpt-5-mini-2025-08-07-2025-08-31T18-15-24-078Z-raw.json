  "solvingStrategy": "1) Inspect training examples to identify the repeating motifs and how the outputs are derived. 2) Observe that training grids contain tiled small patterns (3x3 motifs) of a single nonzero color surrounded by zeros; the outputs are sequences of 3-element rows representing the motif columns or rows, repeated for each tile in a scanning order. 3) Example 3 clearly shows a 3x3 motif of color 7 with a zero center; the output lists the 3-column vectors of that motif repeatedly (columns [7,7,7], [7,0,7], [7,7,7]) for each tile encountered, producing 17 rows in total. 4) Map this rule to test inputs: identify dominant tiled motif color (here color 4 appears repeatedly in tiled 3x3 blocks) and output the motif columns as 3-element rows repeated for each tile position scanned vertically/horizontally as in training. 5) Produce a list of 17 rows alternating the full column and the center-zero column, using color 4 as the motif color for the test input.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Noted that training outputs are not subgrids of original full resolution but compressed representations: each output row is length 3 (or 2 in some examples) matching motif column size.",
    "Example 3 motif: 3x3 blocks of color 7 with center 0. Output enumerates columns [7,7,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,7] repeatedly ‚Äî so each tile contributes three rows in output but because tiles are tiled and scanned, the sequence repeats producing 17 rows.",
    "Example 2 involved 2-column motifs (resulting in 2-length rows). Example 1 compresses larger colored band into a small 3x6 summary; so consistent theme: compress each tile into its column-vectors and list them in scan order.",
    "Apply to Test1: detect the predominant 3x3 tiled motif (color 4) and produce the same column-vector listing pattern: alternating [4,4,4] and [4,0,4] rows repeated for each tile encountered until matching training-output length (17 rows as in example 3)."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation extracts the fundamental small tile motif from a tiled region of the input (tile size varies 2x2 or 3x3 depending on the example), then outputs a list of the motif's column vectors (each column becomes a row in the output). The tiles are scanned in the same order as they appear in the input and their column-vectors are concatenated into the output. For 3x3 motifs with a hollow center, the column vectors are [c,c,c], [c,0,c], [c,c,c] and these repeat for every tile encountered, producing a tall output with many 3-element rows.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm (best): Identify repeating tile size (n x m). For each tile in raster order, for each column j in tile: append column-vector [tile[0][j],tile[1][j],...tile[n-1][j]] as a row in output. Use the tile's color values directly. Return the list of appended rows as the output grid.",
    "Algorithm (math/concise): Let T be tile size (r x c). For tiles i in scan order and for j=0..c-1, output_row = [T_i[0,j],...,T_i[r-1,j]]. Stack rows in sequence -> output matrix.",
