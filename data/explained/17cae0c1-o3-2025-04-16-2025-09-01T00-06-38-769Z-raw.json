  "solvingStrategy": "1. Each 3×9 input grid is split into three 3×3 blocks (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8). 2. Every training output paints each 3×3 block with a single colour, the same across all three rows, so the task is to identify which solid colour belongs to which 3×3 pattern of 5-pixels. 3. From the four training examples we gathered the following dictionary:   • pattern “all 5s except the centre” → 3   • pattern “only centre is 5”         → 4   • pattern “anti-diagonal 5s”         → 9   • pattern “bottom row all 5s”        → 1   • pattern “top row all 5s”           → 6 4. For the test input the three blocks are:   • Block1 (cols 0-2): bottom row full of 5s → colour 1   • Block2 (cols 3-5): anti-diagonal of 5s   → colour 9   • Block3 (cols 6-8): top row full of 5s    → colour 6 5. Fill each 3×3 block with its colour and copy the same row three times to obtain the 3×9 output.",
