      "confidence": 90,
      "reasoningLog": "First, I am considering the training examples to identify the transformation pattern. Each example has an input grid and an output grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput: A 10x10 grid with some 7's forming a pattern. Specifically, there's a diagonal-like pattern with 7's.\nOutput: The output has a diamond-shaped cluster of 7's centered around where the input had the 7's. It seems like the input has a sparse pattern, and the output fills in to create a solid shape.\n\nIn Example 1 input:\n- Row 3: [0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 4: [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 5: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 6: [0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 7: [0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 8: [0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThis looks like a diagonal line or something, but it's not perfectly diagonal; it's a bit jagged.\n\nOutput:\n- Rows 4 to 7 have a block of 7's: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,0,0], etc. It's a diamond shape.\n\nNow Example 2:\nInput: A 6x6 grid with 8's forming a pattern that looks like a capital 'H' or something.\n- Row 0: [8,8,8,0,0,0]\n- Row 1: [8,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 2: [8,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 3: [8,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Row 4: [8,8,8,0,0,0]\n- Row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput: [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,8,8,8,8,0],[0,8,8,8,8,0],[0,8,8,8,8,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nSo the output is a solid rectangle of 8's, but not full; it's centered or something. Input has a shape, output fills it to a rectangle.\n\nIn input, the 8's are in columns 0 to 2 mostly, but output has them from column 1 to 4, so it's expanded.\n\nSimilarly, Example 3:\nInput: [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,6,0,0,0],[0,6,0,0,0,0],[6,0,0,0,0,0],[0,6,0,0,0,0],[0,0,6,0,0,0]] – this looks like an 'X' pattern or diagonal.\n\nOutput: [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,6,6,0,0],[0,6,6,6,6,0],[0,0,6,6,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]] – again, a diamond shape.\n\nSo pattern seems to be: the input has a sparse pattern of a certain color (7,8,6), and the output fills in to create a solid shape that is the convex hull or something similar, but it's not exactly convex hull; it's more like creating a diamond or ellipse shape around the points.\n\nIn all cases, the output is symmetric and centered.\n\nLet me find the centroid or something.\n\nIn Example 1, the input 7's are around rows 3 to 8, columns 3 to 6 roughly. Output has a diamond from row 4 to 7, column 4 to 7.\n\nIn Example 2, input has 8's in rows 0,1,2,3,4 but not all columns. Output has a block from row 1 to 3, column 1 to 4.\n\nIn Example 3, input has 6's forming an X, output has a diamond.\n\nPerhaps it's about finding the bounding box of the non-zero cells and then filling it with a diamond shape or something.\n\nBut the shape is not always a diamond; in Example 2, it's a rectangle, but wait no, in output it's a rectangle of 8's, but in Example 1 and 3, it's a diamond.\n\nIn Example 2 output, it's a solid rectangle, not diamond. Let's check:\n\nExample 2 output: [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,8,8,8,8,0],[0,8,8,8,8,0],[0,8,8,8,8,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]] – yes, it's a 3x4 rectangle of 8's.\n\nBut in Example 1 and 3, it's a diamond shape.\n\nIn Example 1, input has a pattern that might be intended to be a line, but output is diamond.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to create the smallest axis-aligned ellipse or diamond that contains all the non-zero cells.\n\nMore precisely, it might be to compute the convex hull or something, but since it's grid-based, perhaps it's about the bounding box and then filling a diamond inside.\n\nLet's find the min and max row and column of non-zero cells.\n\nFor Example 1 input:\nNon-zero cells: (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,2), (7,3), (8,4) – let's list coordinates.\n\nRow 3, col 4: 7\nRow 4, col 3: 7\nRow 5, col 2: 7\nRow 6, col 2: 7\nRow 7, col 3: 7\nRow 8, col 4: 7\n\nSo min row: 3, max row: 8\nMin col: 2, max col: 4\n\nIn output, the diamond is from row 4 to 7, col 4 to 7? Output rows: 4 to 7 have non-zero, but col min and max in output: row 4: col 4 and 5 have 7, row 5: col 3,4,5,6 have 7, so min col 3, max col 6 for non-zero in output.\n\nBut input min col is 2, max col is 4, so output expanded.\n\nSimilarly, min row input 3, max row 8, output min row 4, max row 7.\n\nThe center of the points: average row and col.\n\nInput points: (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,2), (7,3), (8,4)\n\nAvg row = (3+4+5+6+7+8)/6 = 33/6 = 5.5\n\nAvg col = (4+3+2+2+3+4)/6 = 18/6 = 3\n\nSo center around (5.5, 3)\n\nIn output, the diamond is centered, with rows from 4 to 7, cols from 3 to 6, so center row 5.5, col 4.5? Min row 4, max row 7, center row 5.5; min col 3, max col 6, center col 4.5. But avg col was 3, not matching.\n\nPerhaps it's not the average, but the bounding box.\n\nBounding box of input non-zero: min row 3, max row 8, min col 2, max col 4.\n\nWidth = max col - min col + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n\nHeight = max row - min row + 1 = 8 - 3 + 1 = 6\n\nBut in output, for the diamond, it seems like the diamond's size is based on the spread.\n\nIn Example 1 output, the diamond has a certain size.\n\nNotice that in all examples, the output shape is symmetric and seems to be an ellipse or diamond fitted to the points.\n\nBut in Example 2, input has a different shape.\n\nExample 2 input: non-zero cells: row 0: col 0,1,2; row 1: col 0; row 2: col 0; row 3: col 0; row 4: col 0,1,2\n\nSo min row 0, max row 4, min col 0, max col 2\n\nBounding box width 3, height 5.\n\nOutput: a 3x4 rectangle from row 1 to 3, col 1 to 4. So min row 1, max row 3, min col 1, max col 4.\n\nThe center of input points: let's list all non-zero cells.\n\nRow 0: col 0,1,2 → three cells\nRow 1: col 0\nRow 2: col 0\nRow 3: col 0\nRow 4: col 0,1,2\n\nSo points: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nAvg row = (0+0+0+1+2+3+4+4+4)/9 = let's calculate: rows: 0,0,0,1,2,3,4,4,4 → sum 0*3 +1+2+3+4*3 = 0+1+2+3+12=18, number 9, avg row 2\n\nAvg col = (0+1+2+0+0+0+0+1+2)/9 = (0+1+2+0+0+0+0+1+2) = 6/9 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666\n\nNot integer.\n\nIn output, the rectangle is centered at row 2 (since min row 1, max row 3, center row 2), col 2.5? Min col 1, max col 4, center col 2.5.\n\nBut the rectangle is not centered perfectly; it's from col 1 to 4, which is 4 columns, so center between 1 and 4 is 2.5, but the grid has integer indices.\n\nPerhaps it's about the bounding box of the non-zero cells, and then drawing a diamond or rectangle based on the aspect ratio or something.\n\nIn Example 2, the input shape is like a capital 'I' or something, but output is a solid rectangle.\n\nNotice that in Example 2, the output is not a diamond; it's a rectangle. In Example 1 and 3, it's a diamond.\n\nWhat's different? The color or the pattern?\n\nIn Example 1, color 7, diamond shape.\nIn Example 2, color 8, rectangle shape.\nIn Example 3, color 6, diamond shape.\n\nBut the color might not matter; it's probably the pattern.\n\nLook at the input patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has points that are not aligned; they form a curve or something.\nIn Example 2, the input has points that are mostly vertical with a horizontal bar, so it's like a stick figure or something.\nIn Example 3, it's an X shape.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to create the convex hull of the non-zero cells, but since it's grid, it might be approximated.\n\nIn Example 1, convex hull of the points would be a polygon, but the output is a diamond, which is not the convex hull; convex hull would include all points, but the diamond might be an ellipse.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's about finding the major and minor axes or something.\n\nLet's list the coordinates for each example.\n\nFor Example 1 input points: (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,2), (7,3), (8,4)\n\nThe points are along a line that is decreasing then increasing in col, so it's like a V shape or something.\n\nOutput is a diamond centered around.\n\nCompute the range.\n\nMin row: 3, max row: 8, so row range 5\nMin col: 2, max col: 4, so col range 2\n\nIn output, the diamond has row span from 4 to 7 (4 rows), col span from 3 to 6 (4 columns), so it's larger in col direction.\n\nThe aspect ratio might be involved.\n\nIn Example 2, input points min row 0, max row 4, row range 4\nMin col 0, max col 2, col range 2\nOutput has row from 1 to 3 (3 rows), col from 1 to 4 (4 columns), so again, col range is larger in output.\n\nIn Example 2 output, it's a rectangle, not diamond, so for some shapes, it's rectangle, for others diamond.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a rectangular shape itself? Input has cells in a pattern that is not filled, but the bounding box is 5x3, and output is a 3x4 rectangle, which is different size.\n\nPerhaps the output is always a filled shape that is the smallest bounding box that contains all points, but then filled, but in Example 1, the bounding box would be from row 3 to 8, col 2 to 4, which is 6x3, but output is 4x4 diamond, so not the bounding box.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is to \"thicken\" the line or pattern to a certain width.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a line of cells, and output makes it a diamond-shaped blob.\n\nSimilarly for Example 3.\n\nFor Example 2, the input is like a capital 'H', and output makes it a solid rectangle.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output rectangle is not the bounding box; bounding box is 5x3, output is 3x4.\n\nLet's find the center of mass or something.\n\nFor Example 2, points: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nCenter of mass row: (0*3 +1+2+3+4*3)/9 = (0+1+2+3+12)/9 = 18/9 = 2\n\nCenter of mass col: (0+1+2+0+0+0+0+1+2)/9 = 6/9 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666\n\nIn output, the rectangle is from row 1 to 3, so center row 2, and col 1 to 4, center col 2.5, so not matching col center.\n\nPerhaps it's about the dimensions.\n\nNotice that in Example 1, the input has a certain number of cells, output has more.\n\nCount non-zero cells in input and output.\n\nExample 1 input: 6 cells with 7\nOutput: let's count 7's in output: row 4: two 7's, row 5: four 7's, row 6: four 7's, row 7: two 7's, so 2+4+4+2=12 cells\n\nSimilarly, Example 2 input: 9 cells with 8\nOutput: 3 rows * 4 columns = 12 cells with 8\n\nExample 3 input: let's see, input has cells at (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (5,2) — wait, row and col indices start from 0.\n\nInput grid: row 0: all 0\nRow 1: [0,0,6,0,0,0] so col 2 has 6\nRow 2: [0,6,0,0,0,0] col 1 has 6\nRow 3: [6,0,0,0,0,0] col 0 has 6\nRow 4: [0,6,0,0,0,0] col 1 has 6\nRow 5: [0,0,6,0,0,0] col 2 has 6\n\nSo points: (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (5,2) — 5 points.\n\nOutput: row 2: [0,0,6,6,0,0] so two 6's\nRow 3: [0,6,6,6,6,0] four 6's\nRow 4: [0,0,6,6,0,0] two 6's\nTotal 8 cells with 6\n\nNot consistent number; Example 1 input 6, output 12; Example 2 input 9, output 12; Example 3 input 5, output 8. Not the same.\n\nPerhaps the output has a fixed size or based on the spread.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to draw a diamond or rectangle that encompasses all points, with the size determined by the standard deviation or something.\n\nLet's calculate the variance.\n\nFor Example 1 points: rows: 3,4,5,6,7,8 — mean row 5.5, variance row: sum (r-5.5)^2 /6 = (2.5^2 +1.5^2 +0.5^2 +0.5^2 +1.5^2 +2.5^2)/6 = (6.25+2.25+0.25+0.25+2.25+6.25)/6 = 17.5/6 ≈ 2.9167\n\nCols: 4,3,2,2,3,4 — mean col 3, variance col: sum (c-3)^2 /6 = (1^2 +0^2 +1^2 +1^2 +0^2 +1^2)/6 = (1+0+1+1+0+1)/6 = 4/6 ≈ 0.6667\n\nIn output, the diamond has semi-major and semi-minor axes perhaps.\n\nIn output, the diamond spans 4 rows and 4 columns, so perhaps the size is based on the max variance.\n\nMax variance is row variance ≈2.92, col variance 0.67, so row spread is larger, but output has equal row and col span.\n\nIn Example 2, points: rows: 0,0,0,1,2,3,4,4,4 — mean row 2, variance row: sum (r-2)^2 /9 = (4+4+4+1+0+1+4+4+4)/9 = (26)/9 ≈2.8889\n\nCols: 0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2 — mean col ≈0.666, variance col: sum (c-0.666)^2 /9 ≈ calculate: c values 0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2\n\nDeviations: for c=0, dev -0.666, squared ~0.444; for c=1, dev 0.334, squared ~0.111; for c=2, dev 1.334, squared ~1.779\n\nNumber of c=0: 5 points (rows 1,2,3, and col 0 of row 0? Points: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) — so c=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) — 5 points\nc=1: (0,1), (4,1) — 2 points\nc=2: (0,2), (4,2) — 2 points\n\nSum (c-mean)^2 = for c=0: 5 * (0-0.666)^2 = 5 * 0.444 ≈2.22\nFor c=1: 2 * (1-0.666)^2 = 2 * 0.111 ≈0.222\nFor c=2: 2 * (2-0.666)^2 = 2 * 1.779 ≈3.558\nTotal sum ≈2.22+0.222+3.558=6.00, variance col =6/9=0.6667\n\nMean col = (0*5 +1*2 +2*2)/9 = (0+2+4)/9=6/9=2/3≈0.6667, yes.\n\nVariance row = sum (r-2)^2 /9\nr values: 0,0,0,1,2,3,4,4,4\nDeviations: r=0: dev -2, squared 4, three points, so 3*4=12\nr=1: dev -1, squared 1, one point, 1\nr=2: dev 0, squared 0, one point, 0\nr=3: dev 1, squared 1, one point, 1\nr=4: dev 2, squared 4, three points, 12\nSum = 12+1+0+1+12=26, variance 26/9≈2.8889\n\nIn output, for Example 2, the rectangle has row span 3 (from 1 to 3), col span 4 (from 1 to 4), so the size might be related to variance.\n\nBut variance row 2.89, col 0.67, but output has larger col span.\n\nPerhaps it's the range or something.\n\nMin and max row and col.\n\nFor Example 1, min row 3, max row 8, range row 5\nMin col 2, max col 4, range col 2\nOutput row span 4, col span 4\n\nFor Example 2, min row 0, max row 4, range row 4\nMin col 0, max col 2, range col 2\nOutput row span 3, col span 4\n\nFor Example 3, input points: (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (5,2)\nMin row 1, max row 5, range row 4\nMin col 0, max col 2, range col 2\nOutput: diamond from row 2 to 4? Output rows: row 2 and 4 have two 6's, row 3 has four, so min row 2, max row 4, range row 2\nMin col: row 2 col 2 and 3, so min col 2, max col 3? Row 2: [0,0,6,6,0,0] so col 2 and 3\nRow 3: [0,6,6,6,6,0] col 1,2,3,4\nRow 4: [0,0,6,6,0,0] col 2 and 3\nSo min col 1, max col 4, range col 3\nBut row range 2 (from 2 to 4), col range 3 (from 1 to 4)\n\nInput range row 4, col 2, output range row 2, col 3.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nPerhaps the output is always a shape that has the same area or something.\n\nExample 1 output area: 12 cells\nExample 2 output area: 12 cells\nExample 3 output area: 8 cells? Row 2:2, row 3:4, row 4:2, total 8, not 12.\n\nExample 3 output has 8 cells, while others have 12, so not fixed area.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to create a kernel or convolution with a diamond-shaped kernel for some patterns, but for Example 2, it's a rectangle.\n\nLook at the input patterns: in Example 1 and 3, the input has a line that is roughly diagonal or has a certain slope, and output makes it a diamond. In Example 2, the input has a vertical line with horizontal bars, so it's more rectangular.\n\nPerhaps for input patterns that are \"line-like\" with certain properties, it becomes diamond, for \"block-like\" it becomes rectangle.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input is not fully block-like; it's sparse.\n\nNotice that in Example 2, the input has cells that are connected in a way that forms a shape with holes, but output fills it.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to find the bounding box of the connected components and then fill it with a solid shape, but the shape type depends on the aspect ratio or something.\n\nIn Example 2, the connected component: all 8's are connected? In input, row 0 col 0,1,2 are connected, row 1 col 0 is connected to row 0 col 0, similarly row 2 col 0, etc., so it's one connected component with a certain shape.\n\nThe output is a solid rectangle that might be the minimal bounding box or something, but in Example 2, minimal bounding box is 5x3, but output is 3x4, which is larger in col direction.\n\nPerhaps it's about the number of cells in rows and columns.\n\nList the row counts and col counts of non-zero cells.\n\nFor Example 1 input:\nRow 3: 1 cell\nRow 4: 1 cell\nRow 5: 1 cell\nRow 6: 1 cell\nRow 7: 1 cell\nRow 8: 1 cell\nCol counts: col 2: 2 cells (row 5 and 6), col 3: 2 cells (row 4 and 7), col 4: 2 cells (row 3 and 8)\n\nIn output, the diamond has row 4: 2 cells, row 5: 4 cells, etc.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation is to \"dilate\" the image with a structuring element that is diamond-shaped for some cases, but for Example 2, it might be rectangular.\n\nIn image processing, dilation with a diamond structuring element would make lines thicker.\n\nFor Example 1, if I dilate with a small diamond, it might make the line thicker.\n\nBut let's see the size.\n\nPerhaps the structuring element size is fixed or based on the input.\n\nNotice that in all examples, the output shape is centered around the input points.\n\nFor Example 1, the center of the output diamond is at row 5.5, col 4.5, while input points have avg row 5.5, avg col 3, so not matching.\n\nAvg col is 3, but output center col is 4.5, so shifted.\n\nPerhaps the output is positioned based on the min and max.\n\nLet's find the min and max row and col of input non-zero.\n\nFor Example 1, min row 3, max row 8, min col 2, max col 4\n\nIn output, the diamond has min row 4, max row 7, min col 3, max col 6\n\nSo the output min row is input min row +1, max row input max row -1, min col input min col +1, max col input max col +2? Not consistent.\n\nFor Example 2, input min row 0, max row 4, min col 0, max col 2\nOutput min row 1, max row 3, min col 1, max col 4\nSo min row output = input min row +1, max row output = input max row -1, min col output = input min col +1, max col output = input max col +2\n\nFor Example 3, input min row 1, max row 5, min col 0, max col 2\nOutput min row 2, max row 4, min col 1, max col 4? From earlier, output min col 1, max col 4, min row 2, max row 4\nSo min row output = input min row +1, max row output = input max row -1, min col output = input min col +1, max col output = input max col +2\n\nOh! Seems consistent across examples.\n\nFor all training examples, the output bounding box is:\nmin_row_out = min_row_in + 1\nmax_row_out = max_row_in - 1\nmin_col_out = min_col_in + 1\nmax_col_out = max_col_in + 2\n\nLet's verify.\n\nExample 1:\nmin_row_in = 3, min_row_out = 4, yes +1\nmax_row_in = 8, max_row_out = 7, yes -1\nmin_col_in = 2, min_col_out = 3, yes +1\nmax_col_in = 4, max_col_out = 6, yes +2\n\nExample 2:\nmin_row_in = 0, min_row_out = 1, +1\nmax_row_in = 4, max_row_out = 3, -1\nmin_col_in = 0, min_col_out = 1, +1\nmax_col_in = 2, max_col_out = 4, +2\n\nExample 3:\nmin_row_in = 1, min_row_out = 2, +1\nmax_row_in = 5, max_row_out = 4, -1\nmin_col_in = 0, min_col_out = 1, +1\nmax_col_in = 2, max_col_out = 4, +2\n\nPerfect! So the output bounding box is defined by min_row_out = min_row_in + 1, max_row_out = max_row_in - 1, min_col_out = min_col_in + 1, max_col_out = max_col_in + 2\n\nNow, within this bounding box, what is filled? In Example 1 and 3, it's a diamond shape, in Example 2, it's a full rectangle.\n\nWhat determines the shape? Look at the input.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a pattern that is not rectangular; it's a line.\nIn Example 2, the input has a pattern that is more block-like or has multiple rows and columns with cells.\nIn Example 3, it's a line-like pattern.\n\nPerhaps it depends on whether the input cells are mostly on a single row or column or distributed.\n\nIn Example 1, the cells are on different rows and columns, but not filled.\nIn Example 2, there are cells in multiple rows and columns, and it's somewhat filled in the bounding box? Input bounding box min row 0 max row 4 min col 0 max col 2, and within that, there are cells, but not full.\n\nThe number of non-zero cells or the density.\n\nFor Example 1, input has 6 cells in a 6x3 bounding box, density low.\nOutput diamond.\n\nExample 2, input has 9 cells in a 5x3 bounding box, density higher.\nOutput rectangle.\n\nExample 3, input has 5 cells in a 5x3 bounding box (min row 1 max row 5 min col 0 max col 2, so 5 rows, 3 columns), density medium, output diamond.\n\nNot clear.\n\nPerhaps the shape is determined by the aspect ratio of the input bounding box.\n\nInput bounding box aspect ratio.\n\nExample 1: width (col) = max_col - min_col +1 = 4-2+1=3, height (row) =8-3+1=6, aspect ratio height/width =6/3=2\n\nOutput: diamond shape.\n\nExample 2: width=2-0+1=3, height=4-0+1=5, aspect ratio 5/3≈1.666\n\nOutput: rectangle.\n\nExample 3: width=2-0+1=3, height=5-1+1=5, aspect ratio 5/3≈1.666, same as Example 2, but output is diamond, not rectangle. Inconsistency.\n\nExample 3 input bounding box: min row 1, max row 5, so number of rows: 5, min col 0, max col 2, number of columns: 3, aspect ratio 5/3≈1.666, but output is diamond, while Example 2 with same aspect ratio has rectangle output.\n\nSo not aspect ratio.\n\nPerhaps it's about the pattern itself.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has cells that form a shape that is not a single line; it has a horizontal bar at top and bottom, so it's like a capital 'I' or 'H', and output makes it solid rectangle.\n\nIn Example 1 and 3, the input is a single line or curve, and output makes it diamond.\n\nFor Example 3, input is an X shape, which is two lines, but still output diamond.\n\nPerhaps if the input cells are all on the boundary of the convex hull or something, but complicated.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is always a diamond if the input min and max row and col satisfy certain conditions, but from examples, when min_col and max_col are close, but in Example 2 and 3, min_col and max_col are both 0 and 2 for Example 3? Example 3 min_col=0, max_col=2, same as Example 2.\n\nmin_col and max_col are same for Example 2 and 3: min_col=0, max_col=2 for both? Example 2 min_col=0, max_col=2, Example 3 min_col=0, max_col=2, yes.\n\nBut output different: Example 2 rectangle, Example 3 diamond.\n\nSo not based on min max alone.\n\nPerhaps it's based on the number of cells or the distribution.\n\nList the input grids.\n\nPerhaps for the test case, I can first find the min and max row and col of non-zero cells, then set min_row_out = min_row_in +1, max_row_out = max_row_in -1, min_col_out = min_col_in +1, max_col_out = max_col_in +2\n\nThen for the shape inside, it might be diamond or rectangle based on something.\n\nBut for the test case, I need to predict, so I must determine the shape.\n\nLook at the test case input.\n\nTest case input: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n\nSo it's an 8x8 grid with 1's.\n\nFind non-zero cells: value 1.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] so col 3 has 1\nRow 2: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] col 1 and 2 have 1\nRow 3: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] col 0 has 1\nRow 4: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] col 0 has 1\nRow 5: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] col 1 and 2 have 1\nRow 6: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] col 3 has 1\n\nRows and cols: let's use indices from 0.\n\nGrid rows from 0 to 7.\n\nRow 0: all 0\nRow 1: col 3: 1\nRow 2: col 1: 1, col 2: 1\nRow 3: col 0: 1\nRow 4: col 0: 1\nRow 5: col 1: 1, col 2: 1\nRow 6: col 3: 1\nRow 7: all 0\n\nSo non-zero cells at: (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (4,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,3)\n\nSo min row: 1, max row: 6\nMin col: 0, max col: 3\n\nNow, according to the pattern, min_row_out = min_row_in +1 =1+1=2\nmax_row_out = max_row_in -1=6-1=5\nmin_col_out = min_col_in +1=0+1=1\nmax_col_out = max_col_in +2=3+2=5\n\nSo the output bounding box is from row 2 to 5, col 1 to 5.\n\nNow, what to fill inside? Diamond or rectangle?\n\nLook at the input pattern: it looks like a diamond or ellipse shape itself? The points are at (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (4,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,3) — this seems like a curved line or something. It might be intended to be a diamond input, so output should be diamond.\n\nIn the training examples, when the input is line-like, output is diamond, when it's block-like, output is rectangle.\n\nIn Example 2, input is block-like with multiple cells in rows, output rectangle.\n\nIn Example 1 and 3, input is sparse line, output diamond.\n\nIn test case, the input has cells that are not all on a single line; there are multiple cells in some rows, but it seems like a symmetric pattern, probably diamond output.\n\nMoreover, in the test case, the input looks like it's forming a diamond shape already but sparse, so likely output will be filled diamond.\n\nAlso, in Example 3, input is X shape, which is like two lines, but output diamond.\n\nSo for test case, I think it should be diamond shape within the bounding box.\n\nNow, how to draw the diamond? In the outputs, the diamond is drawn such that it is symmetric around the center.\n\nFirst, find the center of the output bounding box.\n\nOutput min row 2, max row 5, so number of rows: 4 (rows 2,3,4,5)\n\nMin col 1, max col 5, number of columns: 5 (cols 1,2,3,4,5)\n\nCenter row: since even number of rows, center between row 2 and 5, but rows are 2,3,4,5, so center row is between 3 and 4, say 3.5\n\nSimilarly, columns 1,2,3,4,5, center col 3.\n\nIn diamond drawing, for a grid, the diamond might be defined by the Manhattan distance or something.\n\nIn Example 1 output, the diamond has cells where |row - center_row| + |col - center_col| <= some radius.\n\nIn Example 1, output rows 4 to 7, cols 3 to 6, let's find center.\n\nRows 4 to 7: number of rows 4, center between row 4 and 7? Rows 4,5,6,7, center row 5.5\n\nCols 3 to 6: number of cols 4, center col 4.5\n\nThen the diamond: for example, row 4: cells at col 4 and 5, |4-5.5| + |col-4.5| <= something.\n\n|4-5.5|=1.5, for col=4, |4-4.5|=0.5, sum=2.0; col=5, |5-4.5|=0.5, sum=2.0\n\nRow 5: cells at col 3,4,5,6 |5-5.5|=0.5, for col=3, |3-4.5|=1.5, sum=2.0; col=4,0.5+0.5=1.0? No.\n\nPerhaps the radius is integer.\n\nIn grid, often diamond is defined by the distance from center.\n\nIn Example 1 output, the diamond has a certain size.\n\nThe number of rows in output bounding box: for Example 1, output rows from 4 to 7, so 4 rows, cols from 3 to 6, 4 columns.\n\nThe diamond spans the full bounding box in Example 1 and 3.\n\nIn Example 1, the diamond exactly fills the bounding box with a diamond shape.\n\nSimilarly in Example 3, output bounding box min row 2, max row 4, so rows 2,3,4 (3 rows? Earlier I said min row 2 max row 4, so number of rows: 3 (rows 2,3,4)\n\nMin col 1, max col 4, number of columns: 4 (cols 1,2,3,4)\n\nAnd the diamond is drawn: row 2: col 2 and 3 have 6, so not full row; row 3: col 1,2,3,4 have 6; row 4: col 2 and 3 have 6.\n\nSo the diamond is not filling the entire bounding box; the bounding box has rows 2 to 4, cols 1 to 4, but only certain cells are filled.\n\nIn Example 1, output bounding box rows 4 to 7, cols 3 to 6, and diamond fills: row 4: col 4 and 5; row 5: col 3,4,5,6; row 6: col 3,4,5,6; row 7: col 4 and 5? From memory, row 7: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0] so col 4 and 5, yes.\n\nRow 4: col 4 and 5\nRow 5: col 3,4,5,6\nRow 6: col 3,4,5,6\nRow 7: col 4 and 5\n\nSo the diamond is defined such that for each row, the number of cells filled is based on the distance from center.\n\nCenter row: rows 4,5,6,7, center row 5.5\n\nThe number of cells filled per row: at row 4, |4-5.5|=1.5, but since grid, perhaps the radius.\n\nThe max |row - center| is 1.5 for row 4 and 7, but in terms of cells, the number of filled cells decreases as |row - center| increases.\n\nIn Example 1, center row approximately 5.5, so for row 4, offset 1.5, filled 2 cells; row 5, offset 0.5, filled 4 cells; similarly row 6 and 7.\n\nBut since center is not integer, we need to handle it.\n\nIn general, for a diamond shape in a grid, it's often defined by the size.\n\nNotice that in all cases, the output bounding box has dimensions based on input, and the shape is diamond for line-like inputs.\n\nFor the diamond, the number of cells filled might be determined by the size of the bounding box.\n\nIn Example 1, output bounding box has 4 rows and 4 columns, and diamond is drawn with full diamond.\n\nIn Example 3, output bounding box has 3 rows and 4 columns, and diamond is drawn with row 2: 2 cells, row 3: 4 cells, row 4: 2 cells, so the diamond is smaller than the bounding box.\n\nIn Example 3, min row out 2, max row out 4, so rows 2,3,4 — 3 rows\nMin col out 1, max col out 4 — 4 columns\nBut the diamond only occupies cols 1 to 4 for row 3, but for row 2 and 4, only cols 2 and 3.\n\nSo the diamond is centered within the bounding box.\n\nSimilarly in Example 1, the diamond is centered within the bounding box.\n\nIn Example 1, bounding box rows 4 to 7, cols 3 to 6, diamond is from col 3 to 6 for rows 5 and 6, but for rows 4 and 7, only col 4 and 5.\n\nSo the diamond is symmetric around the center of the bounding box.\n\nLet's find the center of the output bounding box.\n\nFor Example 1, bounding box min row 4, max row 7, so center row = (4+7)/2 = 5.5\nMin col 3, max col 6, center col = (3+6)/2 = 4.5\n\nThen the diamond radius or size.\n\nIn Example 1, the diamond has a certain width.\n\nThe number of rows in the diamond: from row 4 to 7, but only partially filled.\n\nThe extent: the min and max row where cells are filled is the same as bounding box, but not all cells.\n\nFor a diamond, the distance from center.\n\nDefine the center row and col as float, but for grid, we can use integer indices.\n\nPerhaps the diamond is drawn such that for each row, the cells where |col - center_col| <= some value based on |row - center_row|.\n\nIn Example 1, center row 5.5, center col 4.5\n\nFor row 4, |4-5.5|=1.5, and cells at col where |col-4.5| <= perhaps 0.5? But |col-4.5| for col=4 is 0.5, col=5 is 0.5, so if |col-4.5| <= 0.5, but 0.5 is half, so for integer col, it might be |col - center_col| <= floor( something ).\n\nPerhaps the diamond has a fixed size based on the input, but from examples, the size of the diamond is determined by the bounding box size.\n\nIn Example 1, bounding box has 4 rows and 4 columns, and diamond spans full 4 rows and 4 columns with the shape.\n\nIn Example 3, bounding box has 3 rows and 4 columns, but diamond has 3 rows and for cols, it spans 2 columns for top and bottom, 4 for middle.\n\nThe number of columns filled at each row depends on the row offset from center.\n\nLet's calculate for Example 3.\n\nOutput bounding box: min row 2, max row 4, so rows 2,3,4\nMin col 1, max col 4, so cols 1,2,3,4\nCenter row = (2+4)/2 = 3\nCenter col = (1+4)/2 = 2.5\n\nNow, for each row, the number of cells filled:\nRow 2: |2-3|=1, and cells at col 2 and 3, so |col - 2.5| <= 0.5? |2-2.5|=0.5, |3-2.5|=0.5, so if |col - center_col| <= 0.5, but 0.5 is not integer, so for grid, perhaps we use integer distance.\n\nPerhaps the diamond is defined by the Chebyshev distance or Manhattan distance.\n\nManhattan distance from center.\n\nFor Example 3, center row 3, center col 2.5, but since col center is not integer, perhaps we round or something.\n\nIn the output, for row 3, all cells from col 1 to 4 are filled, which is |col - 2.5| <= 1.5 for col=1, |1-2.5|=1.5, etc.\n\nBut for row 2, only col 2 and 3, |2-2.5|=0.5, |3-2.5|=0.5, so if Manhattan distance from center <= 1.5 or something.\n\nDefine the center point. Since the bounding box might not have integer center, we need to choose an integer center or use the min and max.\n\nNotice that in all outputs, the diamond is symmetric around the mathematical center of the bounding box.\n\nFor Example 1, bounding box center row 5.5, col 4.5, and diamond is symmetric around it.\n\nSimilarly for Example 3.\n\nFor the number of cells, it seems that the \"radius\" of the diamond is such that the Manhattan distance from center is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nIn Example 1, for row 4, Manhattan distance from center (5.5,4.5) to (4,4) is |4-5.5| + |4-4.5| = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0\nTo (4,5) = |4-5.5| + |5-4.5| = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0\nFor row 5, to (5,3) = |5-5.5| + |3-4.5| = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2.0\nTo (5,4) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0\nTo (5,5) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0\nTo (5,6) = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2.0\nBut in output, all these cells are filled, so Manhattan distance <= 2.0 for all filled cells.\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum Manhattan distance from center for filled cells is 2.0, for example (4,4) distance 2.0, (5,3) distance 2.0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for Example 3, center (3,2.5)\nFor row 2, col 2: |2-3| + |2-2.5| = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5\nCol 3: |2-3| + |3-2.5| = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5\nFor row 3, col 1: |3-3| + |1-2.5| = 0 + 1.5 = 1.5\nCol 2: 0 + 0.5 = 0.5\nCol 3: 0 + 0.5 = 0.5\nCol 4: 0 + 1.5 = 1.5\nFor row 4, similar to row 2.\nSo all filled cells have Manhattan distance <= 1.5 from center (3,2.5)\n\nBut Manhattan distance is not integer, so perhaps we use a threshold.\n\nIn both cases, the maximum Manhattan distance for filled cells is the same for all, but in Example 1, it's 2.0, in Example 3, it's 1.5, so not fixed.\n\nPerhaps the threshold is based on the size of the bounding box.\n\nFor Example 1, bounding box width in rows: number of rows 4, number of columns 4, so the diamond size is full.\n\nFor a diamond in a grid of size m x n, the number of cells filled can be calculated.\n\nBut in Example 3, bounding box has 3 rows and 4 columns, but the diamond doesn't fill all rows and columns; it has fewer cells.\n\nPerhaps for the diamond, it is always drawn with a size that is the minimum of the row and column range of the bounding box.\n\nIn Example 1, row range of bounding box: number of rows 4, number of columns 4, min is 4, and diamond has \"radius\" 2 or something.\n\nIn Example 1, the diamond has cells from row 4 to 7, but the number of cells per row varies.\n\nThe maximum number of cells in a row is 4, which is the number of columns.\n\nFor a diamond shape, the number of cells at row i is 2* |i - center_row| + 1 or something, but center_row may not be integer.\n\nTo simplify, since the output bounding box is fixed from min and max, and for diamond outputs, the diamond is centered within that box with a size based on the box.\n\nBut for the test case, I need to decide if it's diamond or rectangle.\n\nLooking at the test case input, it resembles Example 3 input, which is diamond output, so likely diamond.\n\nAlso, in Example 2, the input has cells that are not on a single curve; it has a full row of cells at row 0 and row 4, while in test case, no full row, so probably diamond.\n\nSo for test case, output bounding box: min row out = min row in +1 =1+1=2\nmax row out = max row in -1=6-1=5\nmin col out = min col in +1=0+1=1\nmax col out = max col in +2=3+2=5\n\nSo rows 2 to 5, cols 1 to 5.\n\nNow, within this, draw a diamond shape.\n\nFirst, find the center of this bounding box.\n\nBounding box rows 2 to 5, so number of rows: 4 (rows 2,3,4,5)\nCols 1 to 5, number of columns: 5 (cols 1,2,3,4,5)\n\nCenter row = (2+5)/2 = 3.5\nCenter col = (1+5)/2 = 3.0\n\nNow, for a diamond, we need to determine the cells where the Manhattan distance from center is less than or equal to a certain radius.\n\nWhat should the radius be? From examples, it might be based on the size.\n\nIn Example 1, bounding box has 4 rows and 4 columns, center row 5.5, col 4.5, and Manhattan distance <= 2.0 for all filled cells, as calculated.\n\nThe maximum Manhattan distance is 2.0, which is half the number of rows or columns? Number of rows 4, half is 2, number of columns 4, half is 2.\n\nIn Example 3, bounding box has 3 rows and 4 columns, center row 3, col 2.5, Manhattan distance <= 1.5 for filled cells.\n\nNumber of rows 3, half is 1.5, number of columns 4, half is 2, so it takes the min or max? In Example 3, the limit is 1.5, which is half the number of rows.\n\nIn Example 1, half number of rows is 2, half number of columns is 2, limit 2.\n\nIn Example 3, half number of rows is 1.5, half number of columns is 2, limit is 1.5, so it seems the radius is half the number of rows in the bounding box.\n\nNumber of rows in output bounding box for Example 1: 4, half is 2\nFor Example 3: number of rows 3, half is 1.5\nAnd Manhattan distance limit is equal to half the number of rows.\n\nSimilarly, for columns, but in Example 3, number of columns is 4, half is 2, but limit is 1.5, so it's based on rows.\n\nIn Example 1, number of rows and columns are both 4, so half is 2.\n\nIn Example 3, number of rows is 3, number of columns is 4, and the limit is half number of rows, 1.5.\n\nAnd the diamond is drawn with that limit.\n\nFor test case, output bounding box has number of rows: from row 2 to 5, so 4 rows (2,3,4,5)\nNumber of columns: from col 1 to 5, so 5 columns (1,2,3,4,5)\n\nSo number of rows = 4, half number of rows = 2.0\nCenter row = (2+5)/2 = 3.5\nCenter col = (1+5)/2 = 3.0\n\nNow, for each cell in the bounding box, if Manhattan distance from (3.5, 3.0) <= 2.0, then set to the color, which is 1, from input.\n\nManhattan distance: |row - 3.5| + |col - 3.0| <= 2.0\n\nSince row and col are integers, we can compute for each cell.\n\nAlso, the output should only have cells within the bounding box set, outside are 0.\n\nNow, for the color, it should be the same as the input color, which is 1.\n\nIn the training examples, the output color is the same as input non-zero color.\n\nSo for test case, set cells where |row - 3.5| + |col - 3.0| <= 2.0 and within rows 2 to 5, cols 1 to 5.\n\nSince the bounding box is exactly where we compute, we can compute for all cells in grid, but only those in bounding box might be set, but in output, other cells are 0.\n\nNow, let's list the cells in bounding box: rows 2,3,4,5 and cols 1,2,3,4,5\n\nCompute for each:\n\nFirst, center (3.5, 3.0)\n\nManhattan distance <= 2.0\n\nFor row 2: |2-3.5| = 1.5, so |col - 3.0| <= 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5, so col must be where |col - 3.0| <= 0.5, so col=3 only, since |3-3.0|=0.0 <=0.5, |2-3.0|=1.0 >0.5, |4-3.0|=1.0>0.5, etc.\n\n|col - 3.0| <= 0.5, so for integer col, only col=3 satisfies, since |3-3.0|=0.0 <=0.5, |2-3.0|=1.0 >0.5, |4-3.0|=1.0>0.5, |1-3.0|=2.0>0.5, |5-3.0|=2.0>0.5.\n\nBut in the diamond, for row 2, it should have more cells? In Example 1, for row 4, it has two cells.\n\nIn this case, for row 2, |row - center_row| =1.5, and limit is 2.0, so |col - center_col| <= 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5, so only col=3.\n\nBut perhaps we need to use ceil or floor because of integer grid.\n\nIn Example 3, for row 2, |2-3| =1, center col 2.5, |col -2.5| <= 1.5 -1? Earlier for Example 3, Manhattan distance <=1.5, for row 2, |2-3|=1, so |col -2.5| <=0.5, so col=2 and 3, since |2-2.5|=0.5<=0.5, |3-2.5|=0.5<=0.5.\n\nIn Example 3, number of rows in bounding box is 3, half is 1.5, and for row 2, |row - center_row| =1, and |col - center_col| <=1.5 -1? No.\n\nIn Example 3, center row 3, center col 2.5, and limit is half number of rows =1.5\n\nFor row 2, |2-3| =1, so |col -2.5| <=1.5 -1? 1.5 -1 =0.5, yes, so |col -2.5| <=0.5, so col=2 and 3.\n\nSimilarly for row 4, same.\n\nFor row 3, |3-3|=0, so |col -2.5| <=1.5, so col=1,2,3,4 since |1-2.5|=1.5<=1.5, |2-2.5|=0.5<=1.5, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nIn general, for a bounding box with R rows, the radius r = R / 2\n\nThen for each row i in bounding box, the offset d_row = |i - center_row|\n\nThen the allowed col offset d_col <= r - d_row\n\nBut since center_row may not be integer, d_row is |i - center_row|, which may not be integer.\n\nIn test case, R = number of rows in bounding box = 4, so r = 4/2 = 2.0\n\nCenter row = 3.5\n\nFor each row in 2,3,4,5:\n\nd_row = |row - 3.5|\n\nFor row 2: d_row = |2-3.5| = 1.5\n\nThen d_col <= r - d_row = 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5\n\nSo |col - center_col| <= 0.5\n\nCenter col = 3.0\n\nSo |col - 3.0| <= 0.5, so for integer col, only col=3 satisfies.\n\nSimilarly for row 5: d_row = |5-3.5| = 1.5, same as row 2, so only col=3.\n\nFor row 3: d_row = |3-3.5| = 0.5\n\nd_col <= 2.0 - 0.5 = 1.5\n\nSo |col - 3.0| <= 1.5, so col can be where |col-3.0| <=1.5, so col=2,3,4 since |2-3.0|=1.0<=1.5, |3-3.0|=0.0<=1.5, |4-3.0|=1.0<=1.5, |1-3.0|=2.0>1.5, |5-3.0|=2.0>1.5.\n\nSimilarly for row 4: d_row = |4-3.5| = 0.5, same as row 3, so col=2,3,4.\n\nSo for rows 2 and 5, only col 3 is filled; for rows 3 and 4, cols 2,3,4 are filled.\n\nBut in the output, for a diamond, it should be symmetric, and for row 2 and 5, only one cell, but in Example 1, for row 4 and 7, there are two cells, so inconsistency.\n\nIn Example 1, number of rows in bounding box is 4, center row 5.5, for row 4: d_row = |4-5.5| = 1.5, r=2.0, d_col <= 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5, so |col - center_col| <=0.5, center col=4.5, so |col-4.5|<=0.5, so col=4 and 5, since |4-4.5|=0.5<=0.5, |5-4.5|=0.5<=0.5.\n\nIn Example 1, for row 4, two cells are filled, col 4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly for row 7.\n\nIn test case, for row 2, center col is 3.0, |col-3.0|<=0.5, so only col=3, but |3-3.0|=0.0<=0.5, so one cell.\n\nBut in a diamond, it might be that for even number of rows, the center row is not integer, so it works.\n\nIn test case, with center col integer 3.0, for row 2, only col 3 is filled, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, number of rows 3, center row 3, which is integer, for row 2, d_row=|2-3|=1, r=1.5, d_col<=1.5-1=0.5, |col-2.5|<=0.5, so col=2 and 3.\n\nIn test case, for row 3, d_row=0.5, d_col<=1.5, |col-3.0|<=1.5, so col=2,3,4.\n\nNow for the color, it should be 1.\n\nAlso, the output grid should have 0 elsewhere.\n\nNow for the test case, the input grid is 8x8, so output should be 8x8 with 0 where not specified.\n\nSo predicted output: for rows 2 to 5, cols 1 to 5, set cells as above.\n\nSpecifically:\nRow 2: only col 3 is 1\nRow 3: cols 2,3,4 are 1\nRow 4: cols 2,3,4 are 1\nRow 5: only col 3 is 1\nAll other cells 0.\n\nBut is this correct? In the input, the color is 1, so output should have 1 where filled.\n\nNow, to confirm with training examples.\n\nIn Example 3, output has row 2: col 2 and 3 are 6, which matches |col-2.5|<=0.5 for row 2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for test case, we have output bounding box rows 2 to 5, cols 1 to 5.\n\nCenter row = 3.5, center col = 3.0\n\nr = number of rows / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.0\n\nFor each row in 2,3,4,5:\n\nd_row = |row - 3.5|\n\nThen d_col_max = r - d_row\n\nThen |col - 3.0| <= d_col_max\n\nFor row 2: d_row = 1.5, d_col_max = 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5, so |col - 3.0| <= 0.5, so col=3\n\nFor row 3: d_row = 0.5, d_col_max = 2.0 - 0.5 = 1.5, so |col - 3.0| <= 1.5, so col=2,3,4 (since |2-3.0|=1.0<=1.5, |3-3.0|=0.0<=1.5, |4-3.0|=1.0<=1.5, |1-3.0|=2.0>1.5, |5-3.0|=2.0>1.5)\n\nFor row 4: same as row 3, d_row=0.5, so col=2,3,4\n\nFor row 5: same as row 2, d_row=1.5, so col=3\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, for the output grid, we need to create the full 8x8 grid with these cells set to 1, others 0.\n\nAlso, in the training examples, for Example 2, it was rectangle, but for test case, since the input is line-like, it should be diamond.\n\nNow, for the JSON response, I need to output the predicted output grid.\n\nFirst, the grid is 8x8.\n\nRows from 0 to 7, cols from 0 to 7.\n\nWe set cells in rows 2,3,4,5 and cols 1,2,3,4,5 as per above.\n\nSpecifically:\nRow 2: only col 3 is 1\nRow 3: cols 2,3,4 are 1\nRow 4: cols 2,3,4 are 1\nRow 5: only col 3 is 1\nAll other cells 0.\n\nSo the output grid should be:\n\nRow 0: all 0\nRow 1: all 0\nRow 2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] but wait, cols from 0 to 7, so for row 2, col 3 is 1, others 0. But in the bounding box, we have cols 1 to 5, but we only set some.\n\nIn the output, for cells outside the bounding box, they are 0, which is fine.\n\nNow, to write the grid.\n\nAlso, for the JSON, since it's a single test case, I need to set \"multiplePredictedOutputs\": false, and \"predictedOutput\" as the grid.\n\nNow, for the analysis fields.\n\nSolving strategy: I identified that the output bounding box is determined by min_row_out = min_row_in +1, max_row_out = max_row_in -1, min_col_out = min_col_in +1, max_col_out = max_col_in +2. Then, for patterns that are not rectangular (like lines), a diamond shape is drawn within the bounding box, centered at the mathematical center, with Manhattan distance threshold equal to half the number of rows in the bounding box.\n\nKey steps: Analyzed training examples, found consistent adjustment of min and max row and col. For shape, determined that diamond is used for non-rectangular inputs, with size based on row count.\n\nPattern description: The transformation first finds the bounding box of non-zero cells in input, then sets output bounding box with row min and max decreased and increased by 1, col min increased by 1 and max increased by 2. Within this box, a diamond shape is drawn if input is line-like, centered with Manhattan distance <= number_of_rows / 2 from center.\n\nHints: Best algorithm: For each non-zero color, find min and max row and col. Set output min row = min row in +1, max row out = max row in -1, min col out = min col in +1, max col out = max col in +2. Then, if the input pattern is not full (determined by density or shape), draw diamond centered at (avg row out, avg col out) with radius = (max row out - min row out +1)/2. Math: Let R = max_row_in - min_row_in +1, C = max_col_in - min_col_in +1, then output rows from min_row_in+1 to max_row_in-1, cols from min_col_in+1 to max_col_in+2, and for diamond, center row = (min_row_out + max_row_out)/2, center col = (min_col_out + max_col_out)/2, and set cells where |row - center_row| + |col - center_col| <= (max_row_out - min_row_out +1)/2. Emoji: 🔍Find bounds, 📦Adjust box, 💎Draw diamond if sparse.\n\nConfidence: 90, since it worked for training examples, and test case seems similar.\n\nNow for the output grid.\n\nTest case input is 8x8, so output same size.\n\nPredicted output:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]  # but col 3 is index 3, and we have cols 0 to 7, so for row 2, only col 3 is 1\n\nIn the array, col indices start from 0.\n\nSo row 2: col 0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:1, col4:0, col5:0, col6:0, col7:0\n\nSimilarly, row 3: cols 2,3,4 are 1, so [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: same as row 3: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: only col 3 is 1: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: all 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: all 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, to write the 2D array.\n\nAlso, in the bounding box, we have cols 1 to 5, but we set only some, others are 0, which is fine.\n\nSo the predicted output grid is:\n\n[\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n]\n\nYes.\n\nNow for JSON.",
