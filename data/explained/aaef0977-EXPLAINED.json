      "patternDescription": "The output grid is generated based on a fixed sequence of 9 digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9, excluding 7) and the position and value of the single non-'7' cell in the input grid. The pattern involves calculating relative coordinates from the special cell, deriving an 'offset' value based on these relative coordinates, and then using this offset to select a digit from the fixed sequence, starting from an index determined by the special cell's value.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Identify the single non-'7' cell in the input grid. Let its coordinates be (R, C) and its value be V.\n2. Define a fixed base sequence of 9 digits (excluding 7): `BASE_SEQUENCE = [9,8,2,5,0,4,3,1,6]`. This sequence is derived by observing the diagonal patterns in the example outputs.\n3. Create a mapping `idx_BASE` from each digit in `BASE_SEQUENCE` to its index (e.g., `idx_BASE(9)=0`, `idx_BASE(8)=1`, ..., `idx_BASE(6)=8`).\n4. For each cell (r, c) in the 8x8 output grid:\n   a. Calculate the relative row and column coordinates with toroidal wrapping: `dr = (r - R + 8) % 8` and `dc = (c - C + 8) % 8`.\n   b. Determine an 'offset' value based on `dr` and `dc` using the following rule, which was reverse-engineered from the training examples:\n      `offset = (dr - dc + 8) % 8`\n      If `dr < dc`, then `offset = (offset + 1) % 9`. (This adjustment accounts for the specific 'wave' pattern observed in the relative index grid).\n   c. Calculate the final index into `BASE_SEQUENCE`: `final_idx = (idx_BASE(V) + offset) % 9`.\n   d. The value for `output[r][c]` is `BASE_SEQUENCE[final_idx]`.\n\nApplying this strategy to the test case:\n- Input special cell: (R, C) = (2, 1), V = 0.\n- `BASE_SEQUENCE = [9,8,2,5,0,4,3,1,6]`.\n- `idx_BASE(0) = 4`.\n\nCalculate `predictedOutput[r][c]` for all `r, c`:\n- For each `(r, c)`:\n  - `dr = (r - 2 + 8) % 8`\n  - `dc = (c - 1 + 8) % 8`\n  - `offset = (dr - dc + 8) % 8`\n  - If `dr < dc`, `offset = (offset + 1) % 9`\n  - `final_idx = (4 + offset) % 9`\n  - `predictedOutput[r][c] = BASE_SEQUENCE[final_idx]`\n\nExample calculation for `predictedOutput[0][0]`:\n- `r=0, c=0`\n- `dr = (0 - 2 + 8) % 8 = 6`\n- `dc = (0 - 1 + 8) % 8 = 7`\n- `offset = (6 - 7 + 8) % 8 = 7`\n- Since `dr (6) < dc (7)`, `offset = (7 + 1) % 9 = 8`\n- `final_idx = (idx_BASE(0) + offset) % 9 = (4 + 8) % 9 = 12 % 9 = 3`\n- `predictedOutput[0][0] = BASE_SEQUENCE[3] = 5`\n\nRepeating this for all cells yields the predicted output grid.",
