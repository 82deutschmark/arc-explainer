Example 3 shows a phase shift of the background lattice but preserves the same central 9 overlay footprint.\n- For the test case, select the template matching example 2 due to similarity in sparsity and arrangement (non-background appearing in certain columns), and project the same background grid and central 9 pattern.\n- Output the 16x16 grid accordingly.",
