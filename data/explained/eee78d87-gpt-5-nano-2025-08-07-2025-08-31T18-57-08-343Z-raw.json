  "solvingStrategy": "I attempted to deduce the ARC transformation by comparing the training examples. The inputs are small grids (6x6) with a few distinct values (7, and some 1/3/6 in examples). The outputs are much larger grids (16x16) consisting of 0, 7, and 9, arranged in a highly regular, tiled pattern. Observations from training:\n- Value 7 in the input tends to produce 7s in many positions within the output pattern, forming a repeating tile structure.\n- Non-7 values in the input (1, 3, 6) tend to correspond to 0s or 9s in the output; notably, 3 and 6 map to regions containing 9s, while 1 maps to zeros in certain blocks.\n- The overall transformation looks like a block-wise expansion where each input cell becomes a 4x4 or similar sub-block in the output, with the resulting color depending on the input value and possibly its neighbors.\n- The 9s appear in locations associated with the unusual values (non-7) in the input, forming a distinct pattern against the 7s background.\n- The test input introduces 2s in four positions forming a loose cross/square pattern. Based on prior mappings (3 -> 9, 6 -> 9, 1 -> 0), it is plausible that 2 would also introduce 9s in its corresponding output blocks, contrasting with the 7 background.\n\nGiven the uncertain mapping and to provide a concrete output, I assume the transformation expands each input cell into a region in the 16x16 output, with 7s preserved as 7s in a tiled pattern, and 2s mapped to 9s in their respective output regions, while other regions remain 0s as in the training patterns where non-7 values appear as 9s or 0s depending on context. The exact positioning is inferred as aligning the 4x4 blocks corresponding to input coordinates into the 16x16 grid. The resulting grid will be a 16x16 matrix with 0s, 7s, and 9s placed to reflect a square of 9s at the coordinates corresponding to the 2s in the input, surrounded by a background of 7s and zeros as in the examples.",
  "patternDescription": "Block-tiling expansion from 6x6 to 16x16. 7s form a repeating tile background. Non-7 values map to 9s in their corresponding blocks; 1s map to 0s in some blocks (per training examples), 3 and 6 map to 9s. For this test, 2s are treated similarly to 3/6 with 9s in their blocks.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm 1 (best): Determine block coordinates for each input cell, map value 7 -> background tile 7, non-7 -> 9 (or 0 in specific contexts) within the corresponding block, then assemble the 16x16 output by tiling these blocks.",
    "Algorithm 2 (math): Use a matrix expansion M where outputBlock[i][j] = f(input[i//k][j//k]) with k being the block size (derived from training, likely 2-4). f maps 7->7, others to 9 or 0 depending on value, mimicking observed patterns.",
    "Algorithm 3 (emojis): Build a 4x4 emoji grid per input cell where 7 is a blue tile (representing 7), 2 is a red dot (representing 9), and 0/empty corresponds to blank spaces. Assemble the big grid by placing each emoji-tile grid at the corresponding input cell location."
