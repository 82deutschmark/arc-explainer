  "solvingStrategy": "We analyze the training examples and observe that the 3x3 blocks (since each input/output is 3x9, effectively a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks) are uniformly filled with a single digit per block in the output. The digit assigned to each block varies between examples and does not simply follow a fixed mapping from block position (left/middle/right). However, the consistent pattern is that each 3x3 region in the output is a solid color (a uniform digit). For the test case, I produce a plausible uniform-digit fill for each 3x3 block, maintaining the observed structural rule (solid blocks) even though the exact mapping of digits to blocks is not deducible with high confidence from the limited examples.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Identify that inputs and outputs are 3x9 grids, which can be viewed as 3 blocks of width 3 (i.e., 3x3 blocks).",
    "Observe that in every output, each 3x3 block is filled with a single repeated digit; the digits differ by block and by example, suggesting a block-wise color fill based on some rule not explicitly consistent across the training examples.",
    "For the test case, apply the same structural rule (solid color per 3x3 block) and choose arbitrary but distinct digits for each block to reflect the block-wise uniform filling observed in training data.",
    "Produce a 3x9 grid where left 3x3 block uses one digit, middle 3x3 block uses another, and right 3x3 block uses a third digit."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "Output is formed by partitioning the 3x9 grid into three 3x3 blocks across columns; each block in the output is a solid color (uniform digit). The specific digits per block vary across examples, indicating a block-wise color assignment rather than a simple positional rule.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm 1 (best): For a 3x9 input, divide into three 3x3 blocks; for each block, assign a distinct digit based on an internal mapping learned from training data. Output blocks are filled with that digit.",
    "Mathematical approach: Let blocks B1, B2, B3. Choose digits d1, d2, d3 such that (d1, d2, d3) is a unique triple per test case, and fill each block with its corresponding digit.",
    "Emoji concept: ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸªðŸŸ¨ blocks correspond to left/middle/right blocks; assign a color code per block and fill the 3x3 region with that code."
