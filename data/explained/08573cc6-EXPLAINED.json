In each case the two nonzero digits from the top row become the markers for the spiral’s horizontal edges (the fill digit for the top and bottom borders) and for the vertical edges (the digit used on the right side and at the left turning points). The third nonzero – located further down – is preserved in the center of the spiral. The spiral is constructed in layers. The outer layer uses the outermost border positions in a contiguous block, with the top row filled by repeating the left top digit (A) and ending with the right top digit (B), the right border entirely filled with B, the bottom border filled with A except for a leading B, and the left border with B. Then an inner layer is drawn with similar rules, and this process recurses until the central layer is reached – which is only one row in which the central cell is replaced by the inner nonzero value. For the test input, the first row has [2,8,...] so A=2 and B=8 and the inner nonzero is 1. By comparing the structure and dimensions in the examples and scaling them to a 13×13 grid, we determined that the spiral is drawn in a contiguous block that spans 11 columns (with two trailing columns left zero) and 11 rows (positioned starting at row 2, leaving two initial rows zero). The layered construction we used is analogous to that observed in Example 3. In our solution the outer (layer0) block of the spiral is 11×11 and is filled as follows: the top row is [2,...,2,8], the bottom row is [8,2,...,2,8], and the leftmost and rightmost columns (for the intervening rows) are set to 8. Then subsequent inner layers (layer1, layer2, etc.) are drawn by taking an offset rectangle and using the same rule—with the top horizontal segment filled with 2 (except for its last cell, 8) and the bottom horizontal segment beginning with 8 followed by 2’s, while the left and right edges are given 8’s. The innermost layer (a 1×3 row) has its middle cell replaced by the inner nonzero 1. Finally this 11×11 spiral block is overlaid onto the 13×13 grid (with the remaining cells left as 0).",

For Example 3, the setup appears similar, where the border is made using the top two nonzero values while placing a third nonzero inside. It looks like these transformations create a thicker border, perhaps indicating a rule that involves scaling and filling around a center. I'm keen to explore how these components interact further!"

      "solvingStrategy": "We observed that in all training examples the output shows a drawn spiral‐like border superimposed onto the grid. In each case the two nonzero digits from the top row become the markers for the spiral’s horizontal edges (the fill digit for the top and bottom borders) and for the vertical edges (the digit used on the right side and at the left turning points). The third nonzero – located further down – is preserved in the center of the spiral. The spiral is constructed in layers. The outer layer uses the outermost border positions in a contiguous block, with the top row filled by repeating the left top digit (A) and ending with the right top digit (B), the right border entirely filled with B, the bottom border filled with A except for a leading B, and the left border with B. Then an inner layer is drawn with similar rules, and this process recurses until the central layer is reached – which is only one row in which the central cell is replaced by the inner nonzero value. For the test input, the first row has [2,8,...] so A=2 and B=8 and the inner nonzero is 1. By comparing the structure and dimensions in the examples and scaling them to a 13×13 grid, we determined that the spiral is drawn in a contiguous block that spans 11 columns (with two trailing columns left zero) and 11 rows (positioned starting at row 2, leaving two initial rows zero). The layered construction we used is analogous to that observed in Example 3. In our solution the outer (layer0) block of the spiral is 11×11 and is filled as follows: the top row is [2,...,2,8], the bottom row is [8,2,...,2,8], and the leftmost and rightmost columns (for the intervening rows) are set to 8. Then subsequent inner layers (layer1, layer2, etc.) are drawn by taking an offset rectangle and using the same rule—with the top horizontal segment filled with 2 (except for its last cell, 8) and the bottom horizontal segment beginning with 8 followed by 2’s, while the left and right edges are given 8’s. The innermost layer (a 1×3 row) has its middle cell replaced by the inner nonzero 1. Finally this 11×11 spiral block is overlaid onto the 13×13 grid (with the remaining cells left as 0).",
