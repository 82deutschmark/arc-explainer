      "patternDescription": "From the training examples, the transformation pattern involves creating a larger grid that is a symmetric reflection of the input grid. The output grid is always 2n x 2n when the input is n x n (here n=3). The pattern shows that the output grid is constructed by: 1) Placing the original grid in the top-left quadrant, 2) Reflecting it horizontally to create the top-right quadrant, 3) Reflecting it vertically to create the bottom-left quadrant, and 4) Reflecting both horizontally and vertically (or equivalently, rotating 180 degrees) to create the bottom-right quadrant. This creates perfect symmetry across both the vertical and horizontal axes through the center of the grid.",
      "solvingStrategy": "Step 1: The input is a 3x3 grid: [[1,1,0],[0,3,2],[3,3,0]]. Step 2: Place this grid in the top-left quadrant of a 6x6 output grid. Step 3: For the top-right quadrant, reflect the top-left quadrant horizontally (reverse each row): row0 [1,1,0] becomes [0,1,1], row1 [0,3,2] becomes [2,3,0], row2 [3,3,0] becomes [0,3,3]. Step 4: For the bottom-left quadrant, reflect the top-left quadrant vertically (reverse the order of rows): becomes [[3,3,0],[0,3,2],[1,1,0]]. Step 5: For the bottom-right quadrant, reflect the top-left quadrant both horizontally and vertically (which is equivalent to the horizontal reflection of the bottom-left or vertical reflection of the top-right): becomes [[0,3,3],[2,3,0],[0,1,1]]. Step 6: Combine all quadrants to form the complete 6x6 output grid: [[1,1,0,0,1,1],[0,3,2,2,3,0],[3,3,0,0,3,3],[3,3,0,0,3,3],[0,3,2,2,3,0],[1,1,0,0,1,1]].",
      "hints": [
        "The output grid size doubles in both dimensions (3x3 input becomes 6x6 output).",
        "The transformation creates perfect symmetry across both the vertical and horizontal center axes.",
        "Each quadrant is derived from the original grid through specific reflection operations: top-left (original), top-right (horizontal flip), bottom-left (vertical flip), bottom-right (both flips)."
