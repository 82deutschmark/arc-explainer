      "solvingStrategy": "Analyzing the training examples, the transformation involves shifting blocks of the value 3 to the left within rows where they appear, specifically when 3s are adjacent and not blocked by non-zero values (i.e., 8s or other numbers that might act as barriers). In Example 1, the input has a group of 3s at the end of a row, and in the output, they are shifted left, replacing zeros but stopping when they encounter non-zero values or when they would go out of bounds. Similarly, in Example 2, a group of 3s is moved left, and in Example 3, multiple groups are shifted. The key insight is that for each contiguous group of 3s in a row, they are shifted left as far as possible without overlapping non-zero values (0 is ignored as it can be overwritten). For the test case input, identify rows with contiguous groups of 3s: row 3 has a group ending at columns 7-8, row 4 has a group ending at columns 7-8, row 5 has a group ending at columns 7-8, and row 6 has a group ending at columns 7-8. These groups should be shifted left until they hit non-zero values. In row 3, shifting the group [3,3] from columns 7-8 left to columns 6-7, as columns 0-5 are zeros, and columns 6 is 0, so it can be overwritten, but column 5 is 0, but we shift one cell at a time until non-zero or start; actually, shifting the entire group left by the number of cells possible without collision. After testing, the output should have the 3s moved left appropriately. Detailed step-by-step application shows the predicted grid.",
      "keySteps": [
        "Step 1: Review all training inputs and outputs to identify common changes.",
        "Step 2: Notice that in each example, groups of the value 3 are moved leftward in their rows, replacing zeros but not non-zeros.",
        "Step 3: For Example 1, input row 1 has 3 at column 7, output has it at column 5? Actually, row indices: In Example 1 input, last value is 3 in multiple rows, e.g., row 0 ends with 3, output has it shifted; row 1 input ends with 3, output has it at column 5 (indexing from 0).",
        "Step 4: Refine the pattern: For each row, if there is a contiguous block of 3s at the end, shift it left until it hits a non-zero value (non-0 or non-3, but 8 is non-zero). Zeros are overwritten.",
        "Step 5: Apply to test case: Identify rows with 3s. Rows 3,4,5,6 have 3s at the end. Shift them left. For row 3: [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,3,3] -> shift [3,3] left by 2 positions to columns 5-6? Check barriers: columns 0-6 are all 0 or 8? Column 1 is 8, so cannot shift beyond that. Actually, shift until first non-zero from left? No, shift the group as a whole to the leftmost possible position without overlapping non-zeros.",
        "Step 6: Implement shifting: For a group of 3s starting at column j, find the leftmost column k such that all cells from k to k+len-1 are zero or can be overwritten (but only zeros are overwritten, non-zeros block). In practice, shift left until a non-zero is encountered.",
        "Step 7: For test row 3: indices 0-8, values [0,8,0,0,0,0,0,3,3]. Group of 3s at col7-8. Shift left: col6 is 0, so move to col6-7? Then col5 is 0, move to col5-6? Col4 is 0, move to col4-5? Col3 is 0, move to col3-4? Col2 is 0, move to col2-3? Col1 is 8 (non-zero), so cannot shift beyond col2. Thus, place group at col2-3: [0,8,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]. Similarly for other rows.",
        "Step 8: After applying to all affected rows, construct the full output grid."
      ],
      "patternDescription": "For each row in the grid, if there is a contiguous block of cells with value 3, shift that block leftwards as far as possible without overlapping any non-zero values (where non-zero includes 8 and other numbers, but 0 is considered empty and can be overwritten). The shift moves the entire block to the leftmost consecutive positions where all cells are currently 0, stopping when a non-zero value is encountered.",
      "hints": [
        "Look for groups of 3s at the ends of rows in inputs and how they move left in outputs.",
        "Non-zero values like 8 act as barriers that prevent further shifting of 3s.",
