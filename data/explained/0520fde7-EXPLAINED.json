      "patternDescription": "From the training examples, the transformation pattern involves identifying the positions of the number 5 in each row (which always appears at index 3) and then counting the number of 1s in the two segments before and after the 5. The output grid has the same number of rows as the input, but only 3 columns. For each row, the first element is the count of 1s in indices 0-1 (before the 5), the second element is always 0 (since index 3 is 5, not counted), and the third element is the count of 1s in indices 4-6 (after the 5). However, in the outputs, the counts are sometimes doubled (multiplied by 2) under certain conditions that relate to the presence of 1s in adjacent rows at the same column positions around the 5. Specifically, if a row has a 1 at index 2 (just before the 5) and the row above or below has a 1 at index 4 (just after the 5), or vice versa, it triggers a doubling of the count for that segment. But after re-examining, the pattern is simpler: the output for each row is [count of 1s in indices 0-1, 0, count of 1s in indices 4-6], but these counts are doubled (multiplied by 2) if the row has a 1 at index 2 (the position immediately before the 5) OR if the row has a 1 at index 4 (the position immediately after the 5). This doubling effect is applied to both segments independently based on the presence of 1s at these flanking positions.",
      "solvingStrategy": "Step 1: For the test input [[1,0,1,5,1,0,1],[0,1,0,5,1,0,1],[1,0,1,5,0,1,0]], note that each row has 7 elements with 5 at index 3. Step 2: For row 0: indices 0-1 are [1,0] with count 1, indices 4-6 are [1,0,1] with count 2. Check for doubling: index 2 is 1 (present) and index 4 is 1 (present), so both segments should be doubled. Thus, output row 0: [1*2, 0, 2*2] = [2,0,4]. But output grids in examples have max 2, so perhaps only one doubling per segment or specific rule. Re-evaluate pattern from examples. In Example 1: Row 0: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0] -> indices 0-1: count 2, indices 4-6: count 1; index 2 is 0, index 4 is 0, so no doubling, but output is [0,2,0] which is not matching. This indicates my initial pattern is wrong. Let's derive correctly. From examples: In Example 1, input row 0: [1,1,0,5,0,1,0] -> output [0,2,0]. The 2 is at position 1 (middle), which corresponds to the count of 1s in the entire row except index 3? But that would be 3 ones, not 2. Alternatively, it might be counting 1s in the neighbors of the 5. Specifically, for each row, the output is a 3-element list where the elements are the counts of 1s in the columns that are symmetric around the 5. Since the 5 is at index 3, the symmetric pairs are (2,4), (1,5), (0,6). The output for each row is [count of 1s in pair (0,6), count of 1s in pair (1,5), count of 1s in pair (2,4)]. In Example 1, row 0: pair (0,6): (1,0) -> count 1, but output has 0; pair (1,5): (1,1) -> count 2, output has 2; pair (2,4): (0,0) -> count 0, output has 0. So it matches. Similarly, row 1: [0,0,1,5,1,1,1] -> pair (0,6): (0,1)=1, output 0; pair (1,5): (0,1)=1, output 0; pair (2,4): (1,1)=2, output 2. Not matching. Perhaps it's not that. Another idea: the output is not per row but based on the entire grid. The output grid has the same number of rows, and each output cell is the sum of the input cells in the same row and column, but only for columns 0,1,2,4,5,6? But output has 3 columns. Actually, the output is a transformed version where we group the columns into three groups: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), and for each row, we sum the 1s in each group. In Example 1, row 0: group (0,6): 1+0=1, group (1,5): 1+1=2, group (2,4): 0+0=0, but output is [0,2,0], not [1,2,0]. So it's not simply sum. It might be that we only count if both elements in the pair are 1, or something. In row 0, group (1,5) has both 1, so count 2; others have not both, so 0. In row 1: group (0,6): (0,1) not both, so 0; group (1,5): (0,1) not both, so 0; group (2,4): (1,1) both, so 2. Perfect. Row 2 same as row 0. So pattern: for each row, for each symmetric pair around the 5 (pairs (0,6), (1,5), (2,4)), if both elements are 1, output 2 for that group; else output 0. In Example 2: row 0: [1,0,0,5,0,1,0] -> pair (0,6): (1,0) not both ->0; (1,5): (0,1) not both->0; (2,4): (0,0) not both->0. Output [0,0,0]. Row 1: [0,1,0,5,1,1,1] -> (0,6): (0,1) not both->0; (1,5): (1,1) both->2; (2,4): (0,1) not both->0. Output [0,2,0]. Row 2: [1,0,0,5,0,0,0] -> all not both, output [0,0,0]. Example 3: row 0: [0,0,1,5,0,0,0] -> all not both, output [0,0,0]. Row 1: [1,1,0,5,1,0,1] -> (0,6): (1,1) both->2; (1,5): (1,0) not->0; (2,4): (0,1) not->0. Output [2,0,0]. Row 2: [0,1,1,5,1,0,1] -> (0,6): (0,1) not->0; (1,5): (1,0) not->0; (2,4): (1,1) both->2. Output [0,0,2]. So pattern confirmed: output for each row is [2 if both index0 and index6 are 1, else 0; 2 if both index1 and index5 are 1, else 0; 2 if both index2 and index4 are 1, else 0]. Now apply to test case: Input [[1,0,1,5,1,0,1],[0,1,0,5,1,0,1],[1,0,1,5,0,1,0]]. For row 0: indices (0,6): (1,1) both 1 ->2; (1,5): (0,0) both 0? But 0 is not 1, so not both 1 ->0; (2,4): (1,1) both 1 ->2. So [2,0,2]. Row 1: (0,6): (0,1) not both 1 ->0; (1,5): (1,0) not both 1 ->0; (2,4): (0,1) not both 1 ->0. So [0,0,0]. Row 2: (0,6): (1,0) not both 1 ->0; (1,5): (0,1) not both 1 ->0; (2,4): (1,0) not both 1 ->0. So [0,0,0]. Therefore, predicted output is [[2,0,2],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].",

        "The output is derived by considering symmetric pairs of columns around the central column (index 3) which always contains 5.",

        "An output value is 2 only if both elements in the pair are 1; otherwise, it is 0."
