      "patternDescription": "It appears that the aliens split each picture into two halves using a special divider (the 🌍 symbol corresponds to the number 5) so that the left block (made of ✅ and ⬛) and the right block form two related images. Then a geometric transformation – perhaps a rotation or a reflection – is applied to one half before the two are compared or overlaid. The final grid is created by marking with the alien symbol (👽, which is 2) those positions where the transformed image and the other half agree (or in some cases where an extra signal is detected). This explanation fits the examples, though it might not capture every nuance for all cases.",
      "solvingStrategy": "Step 1: Notice that the 7 columns always have a central column with a 5 (🌍); this column acts as the divider between two halves. Step 2: Interpret the first 3 columns as the left image (using ✅ for 1 and ⬛ for 0) and the last 3 columns as the right image. Step 3: Consider that one of these images is transformed – maybe rotated by 90°, reflected horizontally, or otherwise manipulated – so that positions from one half can be compared with positions in the other half. Step 4: For every cell in the resulting 3x3 grid, if the transformed left (or right) cell and the other half’s corresponding cell together indicate a signal (a 1 count that sums to 2), then mark that cell with a 2 (👽). Cells that don’t meet the condition remain 0 (⬛). (WARNING: This is a speculative strategy and there might be extra exceptions or nuances not immediately visible.)",
      "hints": [
        "Key insight 1: The central column (🌍) is always used as a divider; focus on the left and right 3-column blocks.",
        "Key insight 2: One block seems to be geometrically transformed (rotated or reflected) before comparing the two halves.",
        "Key insight 3: The output 3x3 grid only shows alien signals (👽, or 2) in specific spots where the transformed parts match, but this logic may have subtle exceptions."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "Based on this rule‐mixing grid overlay and geometric transformation, the aliens might be trying to communicate that their presence – symbolized by 👽 – emerges only when their view aligns with or mirrors part of your world. It could be a coded message like ‘we are hidden until our mirror image is seen,’ or ‘our signal appears when Earth’s image is correctly transformed.’",

The examples suggest that the output shows counts of certain key elements, possibly focusing on the positions of '1's relative to the central '5'.

      "patternDescription": "It looks like the aliens want us to find places in the input grids where a specific pattern of emojis (numbers) appears across each row, and then count occurrences of a particular combination. In particular, for each row, we seem to check the positions before and after the 🌍 (Earth/5) symbol, and count how many times ✅ (1) appears in those positions. We then map the count to 👽 (2) in the output grid at the corresponding spots. However, there may be exceptions or additional rules, so this approach might not always work.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Convert all emojis to numbers for easier manipulation. 2. For each row in the input, find the position of 🌍 (5). 3. Look at the cells immediately before and after the 🌍 (if they exist). 4. Count how many ✅ (1) symbols are directly adjacent to 🌍 in each row. 5. In the output grid, place that count (as 👽 if it's 2, or ⬛ if it's 0) in the corresponding position, possibly only in certain columns. 6. Repeat for each row. WARNING: There could be exceptions where the pattern doesn't hold, or other symbols might matter in other cases.",

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be asking us to notice their presence (👽) wherever there is strong agreement (✅) near something important to humans (🌍, Earth). Perhaps they're saying that when we come together around Earth—when there's unity on both sides—then the aliens are present. Alternatively, it could be a way of marking where alliances or interactions happen. But it's also possible there's a more abstract logic or communication about proximity and cooperation.",

      "patternDescription": "The output grid appears to highlight locations corresponding to where 'positive/agreement' markers (the number 1, shown as ✅) appear in the input grid's first and third rows, counted and marked as 'aliens' (2 = 👽). Specifically, it seems the output counts occurrences of '1's in the outer rows and converts these counts into '2's in the output at matching positions, leaving middle row outputs mostly zeros. This might be a form of pattern extraction focused on the edges or 'boundary signals'. However, this explanation may not hold for all variations of input and output pairs, as the middle row behavior varies and some inputs may involve more complex transformations or logical operations beyond counting ones.",
      "solvingStrategy": "Step 1: Look at the input grid and identify the positions of the number 1 (✅) especially in the first and third (top and bottom) rows. Step 2: Count these '1's and map them onto the output grid as '2's (👽) in the same positions. Step 3: Treat the middle row output as generally zeros unless other rules are explicitly given. Step 4: Think of the puzzle as numbers to spot this pattern rather than emojis at first. Step 5: Be careful, as this might not apply if there are more complex overlays, rotations, or other operations involved. Some puzzles might use reflections or logic gates that change the direct count-to-2 mapping.",

      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be signaling the importance of 'boundary agreement' or 'edge conditions' — marking where 'yes' signals appear on the borders to indicate key positions. Possibly they emphasize 'we' (👽) as distinct from 'you' or 'humans' (👤) by marking these with '2' where confirmations (✅) exist.
