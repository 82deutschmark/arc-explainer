      "patternDescription": "The training examples show that the output is a 3x3 grid derived from the first three elements of each input row. Specifically, for each output row, a value of 2 is placed in the index corresponding to the position of a key 1 in the input row's first three elements, often the last 1 or the only 1, while other positions are 0. This pattern varies slightly between rows, suggesting that the position of 1's (first or last) in the input determines where the 2 goes in the output.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, I analyzed the training examples and observed that the output focuses on the first three elements of each input row. In Example 1, for input rows [1,1,0], [0,0,1], and [1,1,0], the output has 2 at indices where the last 1 is located in those rows. In Example 2 and 3, it's similar but sometimes the first 1. For the test case input rows [1,0,1], [0,1,0], and [1,0,1], I applied this by: Step 1: For the first row [1,0,1], the last 1 is at index 2, so output [0,0,2]. Step 2: For the second row [0,1,0], the only 1 is at index 1, so output [0,2,0]. Step 3: For the third row [1,0,1], the last 1 is at index 2, so output [0,0,2]. Thus, the predicted output grid is [[0,0,2],[0,2,0],[0,0,2]].",
      "hints": [
        "The output grid always has 2 in positions related to the index of 1's in the input row's first three elements.",
        "Patterns show 2 is placed at the index of the last 1 for most rows, as seen in Examples 1 and 3.",
        "If a row has only one 1, the 2 is placed at that 1's index, as in Example 2's second row."
