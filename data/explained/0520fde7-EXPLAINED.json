      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of this as numbers instead of emojis to see the pattern clearly. Split each row at the Earth symbol (5/üåç) into left and right parts. For each position, compare the left side value with the right side value. If they're different, put a 2 (üëΩ) in that position in the output. If they're the same, put a 0 (‚¨õ). The Earth symbol acts as a divider and gets ignored.",

They're showing us how to identify where two patterns don't match, possibly as a way to detect discrepancies or changes. This seems like a neutral, educational communication - they're teaching us their logical thinking process rather than expressing hostility. They may be testing our ability to spot differences, which could be important for future communication.",

      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the emojis as numbers: ‚úÖ=1, üëΩ=2, and so on. Look at the first two rows and count how many ‚úÖ (yes) symbols are there. In the first example, the count is 2. In the second, it's 4. In the third, it's 2. The aliens then use this count to fill the middle row of the answer with that number of ‚úÖ symbols at the start and end (left and right sides), filling the rest with nothing (‚¨õ). For the specific test case, count the ‚úÖ symbols in the first two rows, then place that number of ‚úÖ in the first and third row's edges, leaving the middle row empty.",

      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to communicate how many positive signals (‚úÖ) they see or agree on. They could be sharing a message of agreement or confirming a certain count. It doesn't seem hostile; rather, they might be trying to show us a simple count or agreement related to our signals.",

Count the number of ‚úÖ emojis in each row and column of the input grid. 3. Create a new grid where each position contains the count of ‚úÖ emojis from the original grid. 4. For example, if a row has 2 ‚úÖ emojis, that row in the output will have 2 in the corresponding position. 5. Finally, translate those counts back into emojis: 2 becomes üëΩ.",
      "hints": [
        "Key insight 1: The output grid is based on counting the number of positive signals in the input.",
