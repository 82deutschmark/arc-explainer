The main observation is that the transformation involves changing specific elements in the input grid to different values in the output grid, while keeping other elements the same. The changes seem to follow a pattern where certain numbers are replaced by others in a consistent manner across the training examples.",
    "keySteps": "1. Analyze each training example to identify the specific changes made from the input to the output. 2. Look for a consistent pattern across all training examples. 3. Apply the identified pattern to the test case input to predict the output.",
    "patternDescription": "The pattern involves replacing the number 3 with 5 in certain positions where 3 is not surrounded by 7s on both the left and right, or when it's in the second row and column, and keeping all other numbers the same. This pattern is observed and applied to generate the predicted output for the test case.",
    "hints": [
      "Best approach: Iterate through each element in the input grid and apply the transformation rule based on the observed pattern.",
