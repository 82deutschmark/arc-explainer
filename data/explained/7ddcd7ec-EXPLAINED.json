I think I need a simpler interpretation, where the output grid connects the outermost nonzero points by shifting them along a specific vector. There are two types of diagonals: one goes bottom right if it includes a main diagonal cell, and the other is anti-diagonal if it doesn’t. Looking at the example with digit 4, the added cell coordinates seem to form a downward slope, but the sums of the indices don’t align clearly."

The idea is to copy the cluster into the output and then shift it one row up and one column right as many times as possible without going off the boundary. \n\nLooking at examples, if we shift a cluster downward by (1,1), we technically add cells until the cluster is outside the grid. However, the output seems to consistently add extra cells forming a diagonal, indicating a pattern based on the positions of nonzero clusters. In the examples, it appears I’m consistently adding three to four extra cells compared to the input."

It seems a pattern might exist where, starting from one of the clusters, I extend diagonally in both directions to create an \"X\" shape that totals nine nonzero cells. However, outputs vary; for example, one has eleven nonzero cells. \n\nI notice an interesting trend: between the minimum and maximum rows of a cluster, every row gets a new nonzero that wasn’t in the input. The extra markers create a diagonal that continuously spans a range of rows while steadily increasing in column position. This looks to be the rule for adding cells in the transformation."
