  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed all training examples to identify the pattern. Noticed that in each case, there are vertical columns of 3s that get transformed. The pattern appears to be: for each vertical sequence of 3s, the bottommost 3 in the sequence is replaced with a 5, and all other 3s in that column are replaced with 7s. The transformation only affects cells that are part of vertical 3 sequences, leaving all other values unchanged. Applied this rule systematically to the test case input.",
  "keySteps": ["1. Examined Example 1: The input has a vertical column of 3s in column 1 (rows 1-10). In output, the bottom 3 at (9,10) becomes 5, all other 3s become 7s", "2. Examined Example 2: Vertical 3s in column 2 (rows 2-8). Bottom 3 at (8,2) becomes 5, others become 7s", "3. Examined Example 3: Multiple vertical 3 sequences. Each bottom 3 becomes 5, others become 7s", "4. Applied to test case: Identified vertical 3 sequences in columns 1 (rows 0-12) and column 10 (rows 12-13)", "5. For column 1: Bottom 3 at row 12 becomes 5, all other 3s become 7s", "6. For column 10: Bottom 3 at row 13 becomes 5, all other 3s become 7s", "7. All other values remain unchanged including the existing 5s and 0s"],
  "patternDescription": "For each vertical sequence of consecutive 3 values in a column, replace the bottommost 3 with a 5 and all other 3s in that sequence with 7s. All other values in the grid remain unchanged.",
  "hints": ["Best algorithm: For each column, scan from top to bottom, identify sequences of consecutive 3s, and replace the last 3 in each sequence with 5 and others with 7", "Math algorithm: Let M be the input matrix. For each column j, find all intervals [i_start, i_end] where M[i][j] = 3 consecutively.
