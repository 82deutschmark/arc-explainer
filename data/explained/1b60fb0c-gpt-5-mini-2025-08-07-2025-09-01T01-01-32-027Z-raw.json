  "solvingStrategy": "I examined the three training input→output pairs to find a consistent spatial transformation. In each training example the output is identical to the input except that a set of zeros to the left of the existing 1-pattern become 2s. The 2s exactly correspond to the pattern of 1s shifted two columns to the left, but only where the destination cell was originally 0 (so existing 1s are not overwritten). Therefore the rule: for every cell containing 1 at (r,c), if c-2 >= 0 and the cell at (r,c-2) == 0, set that cell to 2. I applied that rule to the test input to generate the predicted output.",

    "Hypothesized candidate rules: (a) draw a rectangle left of main shape, (b) copy the 1-pattern and shift it left, (c) reflect pattern across a vertical axis. Tested each against training examples and found (b) — shift every 1 two columns left, painting 2s where target is 0 — matched all examples exactly.",
    "Applied the chosen algorithm to the test input: for each 1 at (r,c) set (r,c-2)=2 if within bounds and originally 0.",
    "Constructed the final grid by overlaying resulting 2s onto the original grid without changing any existing 1s or other colors."

    "Algorithmic: For each coordinate (r,c) where grid[r][c]==1: if c-2 >= 0 and grid[r][c-2]==0 then set grid[r][c-2]=2. Return the modified grid.",
