  "solvingStrategy": "Observed that all training outputs are 16√ó16.  A 5√ó5 portion of the 6√ó6 input (rows 0-4, cols 0-4) is taken, each cell expands to a 2√ó2 square.  Between every pair of rows/columns and around the border a 1-cell zero grid-line is inserted, giving:  5¬∑2 + 6¬∑1 = 16.  Mapping colours: original background 7 is copied, every non-7 colour (3, 1, 6 in the examples) becomes 9, the added grid-lines are 0.  Applying the same rule to the test input (with special colour 2‚Üí9) yields the predicted 16√ó16 grid shown.",

    "3 Check color mapping: background 7‚Üí7, any other colour ‚Üí9, gridlines‚Üí0.",
    "4 Construct coordinate mapping: gridline rows/cols at 0,3,6,9,12,15; cell blocks at pairs (1,2),(4,5)‚Ä¶ etc.",
