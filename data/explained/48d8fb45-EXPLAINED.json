      "reasoningLog": "**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI need to analyze the training examples for transformation patterns. The inputs are 10x10 grids, and the outputs are 3x3 subgrids. It seems like the output captures the shape of the second color relative to an anchor marked by the color 5. For instance, in the first input, there's a unique 5 at (1, 7) among other zeros. \n\nThe output grid appears to relate to the surrounding area of 5, specifically showing the pattern of color 4. I’ll look closer at color 4's distribution to identify any emerging shapes or clusters.\n**Examining grid centers**\n\nI'm analyzing the 3x3 area around the color 5 located at (1, 7). I’m trying to see if this grid is centered around that anchor. When I capture the surrounding area, I get [[0,0,0],[0,5,0],[4,4,0]], which doesn't match the output of [[4,4,0],[0,0,4],[0,4,0]]. It seems like the orientation may be off, or the anchor isn’t directly in the center.\n\nNow, if I check the area below the anchor, I consider how the output grid might represent a 3x3 block where 4’s are clustered. Analyzing Example 2 with similar logic shows that the outputs reflect specific color clusters as well.\n**Analyzing cluster transformations**\n\nI'm indexing the grid to analyze the 3x3 areas around various anchors. For instance, with color 5 at (1, 7), I explore the surrounding 3x3 area to look for clusters. However, the resulting grid does not match the output grid, suggesting that the transformation retrieves the strongest cluster shape relative to the anchor.\n\nIn another example, with color 5 at (4, 7), I examine the surrounding 3x3 area as well. It seems that the process is about identifying the most significant clusters of color around these anchors to form the output. I'm considering if the output signifies symmetry or some repeated shape relative to the anchors noted, especially for color clusters observed in Example 2.\n**Computing the subgrid**\n\nI'm computing a 3x3 subgrid starting from the anchor point, which is color 5 located at (0, 6). By moving down one row and left one column, I can extract the corresponding area. The cells from rows 1, 2, and 3 and columns 5, 6, and 7 give us the grid values: [[0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3]].\n\nNext, I’ll verify that this subgrid is within bounds, and it looks good. I need to ensure that it's clearly defined for any output, confirming I feel confident about the predictions.",

      "patternDescription": "Each input grid contains a single cell coloured 5 that serves as an anchor.  From that anchor take the 3×3 window whose top-left corner is located one cell below and one cell to the left of the 5 (i.e. anchor position +[+1,-1]).  Copy that 3×3 window exactly – do not change any colours – and return it as the 3×3 output grid.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Locate the only cell with colour 5.   In the test case it is at row 0, column 6.\n2. Move one row down and one column left: new coordinates (row 1, column 5).  This is the top-left corner of the window to copy.\n3. Read the 3×3 block covering rows 1-3 and columns 5-7:\n   • Row 1 (index 1): [col5 0, col6 3, col7 0]  →  [0,3,0]\n   • Row 2 (index 2): [3,3,0]\n   • Row 3 (index 3): [0,3,3]\n4. Assemble these rows to form the output grid:\n   [[0,3,0],\n    [3,3,0],\n    [0,3,3]]",
