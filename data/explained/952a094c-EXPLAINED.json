Interior values: (4,3)=6, (4,6)=4, (6,3)=8, (6,6)=2. The immediate outside coordinates are rows 2 and 8, columns 1 and 8. Map: 6->(8,8), 4->(8,1), 8->(2,8), 2->(2,1).

Each input seems to include a color rectangle creating a thick line. For instance, I'm seeing rows that have filled rectangles using the number 7 between certain indices. When I check Example 1, there are many 7s forming this rectangle from row indices 2 to 7. Some interior elements, like a 2 in row 4, are mixed with mostly zeros. It’s interesting how the grid structure is set up."
