Check the emojis directly around the center. If you see certain patterns of '0' and '9' nearby, you change the emojis in that small square to '‚ô•' for friendship or 'üëΩ'/'üë§' for other meanings.

The key is that the middle column (the 4th number in each 7-number row) is always '1' (‚úÖ), which acts like a fixed anchor or 'yes' signal. The output‚Äôs 3 numbers correspond to three specific positions in the input row, and the output places '8' (‚ô•, peace/friendship/good) exactly where the input row has '0' (‚¨õ, nothing/negative) in those positions, but only if those positions are near or related to the '1' column. Otherwise, the output is '0' (‚¨õ). Essentially, the aliens highlight peaceful/positive spots (‚ô•) in the input where there is emptiness (‚¨õ) adjacent to the 'yes' column (‚úÖ), ignoring warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è) and other symbols. This creates a kind of 'peace map' around the central 'yes' column in each row.",

Focus on three specific positions around this middle column (positions 1, 2, and 3 or similar depending on the example). 4. For each of these three positions, if the input emoji is '0' (‚¨õ), output '8' (‚ô•) in that position in the output row; if not, output '0' (‚¨õ). 5. Repeat for every row to build the output 5x3 grid. 6. If stuck, switch to thinking of the emojis as numbers to spot the pattern of zeros near the '1' column and map zeros to eights in output.",
