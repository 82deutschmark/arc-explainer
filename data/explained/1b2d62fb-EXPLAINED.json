      "patternDescription": "This puzzle uses a grid operation combined with color pattern matching and object filtering. Essentially, the aliens take each input row with 7 emojis (numbers) and focus on the 3 emojis on the right side (last three positions). They then transform these three emojis by mapping '⚠️' (9) and '⬛' (0) into a new pattern of '♥' (8) and '⬛' (0), where '♥' (8) appears only in specific positions. The transformation filters out the middle column and highlights the corners when certain important symbols (⚠️) appear at those positions in the input. This suggests a spatial and pattern-based extraction of key warning signals and turning them into peaceful signs on the output grid's right side, which always has 3 columns.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at each input row as a sequence of 7 emojis (numbers). 2. Focus on the last three emojis in the row (columns 5, 6, and 7). 3. Notice where the '⚠️' (9) and '⬛' (0) appear in these last three positions. 4. For each row, create a new 3-emoji output row where you mark '♥' (8) if the input's corner positions of the last three columns have '⚠️' (9) or '⬛' (0) in a specific pattern, and '⬛' (0) otherwise. 5. The middle column is usually '⬛' (0) in the output, except when the input pattern indicates otherwise. 6. Repeat this for every row to get the full output grid. Thinking in numbers helps here: 9's and 0's in the input last 3 positions become 8's or 0's in the output, depending on their position.",
      "hints": [
        "Focus only on the last three columns of each input row to determine the output row.",
        "Notice how '⚠️' (9) and '⬛' (0) in the input map to '♥' (8) or '⬛' (0) in the output, only appearing at corners.",
        "The middle position in each output row rarely changes and mostly stays '⬛' (0), acting as a separator or neutral space."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be signaling key warning or alert spots (⚠️) on their communication grid and transforming these into symbols of peace and friendship (♥) in specific spatial arrangements. This could be a coded message that while there are warnings or dangers, the overall intent is peaceful and they want to highlight friendship in certain positions. They may be showing us how to recognize important signals and translate them into friendly responses — not hostility, but careful attention needed.",
