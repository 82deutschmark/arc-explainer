  "solvingStrategy": "We observed that in previous training examples the output grids are smaller, square, and appear to capture a compressed layout of distinct colored (nonzero) regions. In each example a particular overriding value of 5 appears in the top‚Äêleft region of the output, while the other nonzero digits from the input end up distributed into two (or more) groups, with the top half of the output representing one set of blobs and the bottom half representing the other set. Based on the training examples the five unique digits in each puzzle are remapped into a mosaic: an overriding 5 always occupies the top‚Äìleft block, the top row is then split into two groups (with the larger value on the right in some cases) and the bottom half is split into two groups as well. For the test case the input grid contains two groups in the top region (a left blob of 2‚Äôs and a right blob of 3‚Äôs) and two groups in the bottom region (a left blob of 7‚Äôs ‚Äì with a solitary overriding 5 element embedded ‚Äì and a right blob of 8‚Äôs). Mimicking the patterns seen in the training examples (for instance the 10√ó10 output of Example 2), we create an output grid whose top two rows are formed by a left block (filled with the top‚Äêregion left value) and a right block (filled with the top‚Äêregion right value) with the overriding value 5 in the very first column. The bottom eight rows are filled with a left block (from the bottom‚Äêregion left blob, here taken as 7) and a right block (from the bottom‚Äêregion right blob, here taken as 8).",
  "keySteps": [
    "Identify that only nonzero digits in the input matter and that training outputs are a compressed, remapped version of these digits.",
    "Observe that in every example an overriding digit 5 is placed in the top‚Äìleft corner regardless of its original location.",
    "Note that the remaining digits are arranged into two groups in the top half and two groups in the bottom half of the output grid.",
    "Map the test input‚Äôs top region (containing blobs of 2‚Äôs and 3‚Äôs) and bottom region (containing blobs of 7‚Äôs ‚Äì with one overriding 5 ‚Äì and 8‚Äôs) into a grid mosaic.",
    "Emulate the 10√ó10 configuration seen in one training example by assigning block widths 1, 4, and 5 (for the top row) and vertical splitting into 2 top rows and 8 bottom rows."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation extracts the nonzero structure and reinterprets it as a mosaic of four zones. An overriding 5 always appears in the top‚Äìleft cell, while the top half of the output captures the two distinct blobs from the upper part of the input and the bottom half captures the two blobs from the lower part. The digits are remapped into uniform blocks that preserve the relative left‚Äìright and top‚Äìbottom ordering, with the block sizes chosen to mimic the examples‚Äô output dimensions.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm (pseudo-code): Crop input to nonzero area; identify connected blobs and assign them a fixed order (override first, then top‚Äìleft, top‚Äìright, bottom‚Äìleft, bottom‚Äìright); choose a fixed grid size (e.g. 10√ó10) and fill blocks with the corresponding digit.",
    "Math/Description: Let the nonzero clusters be sorted by their spatial centers; force the overriding cluster (digit 5) into the top‚Äìleft; then partition the normalized coordinates into two vertical and two horizontal zones, assigning each zone the mode of the corresponding cluster.",
