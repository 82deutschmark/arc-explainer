          "Examined all training examples to identify the transformation pattern from input to output grids.",
          "Noticed that in each example, the output grid is a shifted version of the input grid, specifically moving the non-zero elements downward by one row, with the bottom row wrapping around to the top if necessary, but in these examples, no wrapping occurs as the bottom row is all zeros or handled by shifting.",
          "In Example 1: Input [[0,2,2],[0,0,2],[0,0,0]] → Output [[0,0,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,2]] – The non-zero elements (2s) are shifted down; the top row becomes all zeros, middle row has the original top row's non-zeros, bottom row has the original middle row's non-zero.",
          "In Example 2: Input [[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]] → Output [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[1,1,1]] – The row with 1s is moved from the middle to the bottom, with zeros above.",
          "In Example 3: Input [[0,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0]] → Output [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,0]] – Non-zero elements are shifted down; top row zeros, middle row has the original top's non-zero (1), bottom row has the original middle's non-zeros (1,1).",
          "In Example 4: Input [[1,1,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] → Output [[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]] – The top row with 1s is moved to the middle row, with zeros above and below.",
          "Generalized the pattern: For a 3x3 grid, the transformation shifts the entire grid downward by one row. The new top row is all zeros (or could be the original bottom row if it had non-zeros, but in these cases, the original bottom row is all zeros, so it becomes zeros). Specifically, output row i is: for i=0 (top), it's all zeros; for i=1, it's the input row 0; for i=2, it's the input row 1. The original input row 2 is lost or becomes the new bottom if not zeros, but in training, row 2 is often zeros, so it's effectively a downward shift with the bottom row zeroed or handled.",
          "Applied this pattern to Test 1 Input: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]. Shift down: new row 0 (top) = all zeros [0,0,0], new row 1 = input row 0 [0,0,0], new row 2 = input row 1 [0,1,0]. So output should be [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]].",
          "Applied to Test 2 Input: [[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,0]]. Shift down: new row 0 = zeros [0,0,0], new row 1 = input row 0 [2,0,0], new row 2 = input row 1 [2,0,0]. But input row 2 is [0,0,0], which is not used. So output should be [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]. However, comparing to training, in Example 1, a similar shift occurred, but in that case, the non-zeros were preserved. Re-checked: In Example 1, input row 2 is [0,0,0], output row 2 is [0,0,2] which is input row 1's non-zero. So pattern is consistent: output row i = input row (i-1) for i>0, and row 0 is zeros. For i=0: output[0] = [0,0,0]; i=1: output[1] = input[0]; i=2: output[2] = input[1]. Input[2] is ignored if it has values, but in training, it's often zeros. For Test 2, output should be [[0,0,0], [2,0,0], [2,0,0]].",
          "Noticed that in all outputs, the bottom row of the input is not carried over; instead, the shift is downward with the top row becoming zeros. This matches the training examples where the input's bottom row is all zeros or not present in output.",
          "Confirmed pattern: The transformation is a downward shift by one row, with the new top row set to zeros. So for any input grid, output[row][col] = 0 if row=0, else input[row-1][col].",
          "For Test 1: Input has non-zero at [1,1] (value 1). After shift, it should be at output[2,1]. Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]].",
          "For Test 2: Input has non-zeros at [0,0] and [1,0] (value 2). After shift, they should be at output[1,0] and [2,0]. Output: [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]].",
          "Double-checked with training: In Example 3, input [0,1,0] at row0 becomes output row1 [0,1,0], and input [1,1,0] at row1 becomes output row2 [1,1,0]. Perfect match.",

The input's bottom row (row 2) is not used in the output and is effectively replaced or lost, which is consistent across all training examples where the input's bottom row is all zeros or not contributing.",
