Observing examples:\\n- Example1: Input has a row of ones in top row columns 0-2. Output moves that row down by one: ones in second row, others zero. Essentially shift the nonzero row downward by one step while preserving row content.\\n- Example2: Nonzero row is middle row. Output moves that row down by one to bottom row.\\n- Example3: Input has a pattern of 1s in positions (0,1),(1,0),(1,1). Output shows these ones moved to (1,1) and (2,0)? Actually Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,0]] which corresponds to shifting the entire pattern down by one row while keeping relative columns same. The original top rowâ€™s 1 in middle moves to (1,1); the middle row has two 1s at (1,0) and (1,1) become at (2,0) and (2,1). But output shows (2,0)=1 and (1,1)=1 and (2,1)=1? Wait check: Output row1 [0,0,0], row2 [0,1,0], row3 [1,1,0]. That places ones at (1,1) and (2,0),(2,1). This is not a simple downward shift of entire pattern by one row because the (0,1) moved to (1,1) yes; the (1,0) moved to (2,0); the (1,1) moved to (2,1). So indeed all ones moved down by one row. So rule: shift all nonzero cells down by one row.\\n- Example4: Input has 2s at (0,1),(0,2),(1,2). Output has 2s at (1,1),(1,2),(2,2): all nonzeros shifted down by one row. Yes consistent.\\nThus transformation: shift all nonzero cells down by one row (towards increasing row index) by exactly one cell; bottom row drop if moved would go out of bounds; but in examples, there is space at bottom to accommodate. So apply to test cases:\\nTest1 Input: [[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,0]] Nonzeros at (0,0)=2 and (1,0)=2. Move down by one: (1,0)=2 and (2,0)=2. So resulting grid:\\n[[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]\\nBut wait check: shifting content, the original (0,0) becomes (1,0); original (1,0) becomes (2,0). Yes. So predicted Output should be [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]. However my initial predictedOutput I put [[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,0]] which is wrong. Recalculate.\\nTest2 Input: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]] Nonzero at (1,1)=1. Move down to (2,1). Result [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]]. Wait (2,1) index row2? rows 0,1,2. So row2 is index2: [0,1,0]. Yes row 2 equals [0,1,0]. So Output [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]].\\nWe only need single test? The prompt says Test 1 and Test 2 predict outputs. We must provide one predictedOutput grid only since multiplePredictedOutputs false. But there are two test cases; however instruction: some puzzles have multiple test cases. In that case multiplePredictedOutputs true and provide predictedOutput1/2. Here they provided two tests; thus we should use multiplePredictedOutputs true. The instruction says for multiple test cases: set true and fill outputs in predictedOutput1,2,3. So we must output in that structure. The initial field says multiplePredictedOutputs must be first field. So we should provide predictedOutput (empty) and predictedOutput1 with first grid, predictedOutput2 with second grid, predictedOutput3 empty. Let's craft accordingly.\\nFirst grid: for Test1: [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]\\nSecond grid Test2: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]]\\nYes.\" , \"keySteps\": [\"Identify transformation as downward shift of all nonzero cells by one row.\",\"Apply to each test case separately by moving each nonzero value to the row below while preserving column.\"], \"patternDescription\": \"Shift nonzero cells down by one row\", \"hints\": [\"Nonzero elements move to next row in examples.\",\"Bottom row becomes new positions if space available.\"], \"confidence\": 68}"

      "solvingStrategy": "We analyze training pairs to infer the rule. Observing examples:\n- Example1: Input has a row of ones in top row columns 0-2. Output moves that row down by one: ones in second row, others zero. Essentially shift the nonzero row downward by one step while preserving row content.\n- Example2: Nonzero row is middle row. Output moves that row down by one to bottom row.\n- Example3: Input has a pattern of 1s in positions (0,1),(1,0),(1,1). Output shows these ones moved to (1,1) and (2,0)? Actually Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,0]] which corresponds to shifting the entire pattern down by one row while keeping relative columns same. The original top rowâ€™s 1 in middle moves to (1,1); the middle row has two 1s at (1,0) and (1,1) become at (2,0) and (2,1). But output shows (2,0)=1 and (1,1)=1 and (2,1)=1? Wait check: Output row1 [0,0,0], row2 [0,1,0], row3 [1,1,0]. That places ones at (1,1) and (2,0),(2,1). This is not a simple downward shift of entire pattern by one row because the (0,1) moved to (1,1) yes; the (1,0) moved to (2,0); the (1,1) moved to (2,1). So indeed all ones moved down by one row. So rule: shift all nonzero cells down by one row.\n- Example4: Input has 2s at (0,1),(0,2),(1,2). Output has 2s at (1,1),(1,2),(2,2): all nonzeros shifted down by one row. Yes consistent.\nThus transformation: shift all nonzero cells down by one row (towards increasing row index) by exactly one cell; bottom row drop if moved would go out of bounds; but in examples, there is space at bottom to accommodate. So apply to test cases:\nTest1 Input: [[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,0]] Nonzeros at (0,0)=2 and (1,0)=2. Move down by one: (1,0)=2 and (2,0)=2. So resulting grid:\n[[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]\nBut wait check: shifting content, the original (0,0) becomes (1,0); original (1,0) becomes (2,0). Yes. So predicted Output should be [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]. However my initial predictedOutput I put [[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,0]] which is wrong. Recalculate.\nTest2 Input: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]] Nonzero at (1,1)=1. Move down to (2,1). Result [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]]. Wait (2,1) index row2? rows 0,1,2. So row2 is index2: [0,1,0]. Yes row 2 equals [0,1,0]. So Output [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]].\nWe only need single test? The prompt says Test 1 and Test 2 predict outputs. We must provide one predictedOutput grid only since multiplePredictedOutputs false. But there are two test cases; however instruction: some puzzles have multiple test cases. In that case multiplePredictedOutputs true and provide predictedOutput1/2. Here they provided two tests; thus we should use multiplePredictedOutputs true. The instruction says for multiple test cases: set true and fill outputs in predictedOutput1,2,3. So we must output in that structure. The initial field says multiplePredictedOutputs must be first field. So we should provide predictedOutput (empty) and predictedOutput1 with first grid, predictedOutput2 with second grid, predictedOutput3 empty. Let's craft accordingly.\nFirst grid: for Test1: [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]\nSecond grid Test2: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]]\nYes.",
