      "confidence": 100,
      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to understand the transformation pattern. Each example shows an input grid and an output grid.\n\nLet's look at the training examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  Input: [[1,1,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n  Output: [[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\n\n- Example 2:\n  Input: [[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\n  Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[1,1,1]]\n\n- Example 3:\n  Input: [[0,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0]]\n  Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,0]]\n\n- Example 4:\n  Input: [[0,2,2],[0,0,2],[0,0,0]]\n  Output: [[0,0,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,2]]\n\nI notice that in all outputs, the non-zero elements seem to be shifted down by one row. But let's check carefully.\n\nIn Example 1: Input has [1,1,1] in row 0, output has it in row 1. So it moved down.\n\nIn Example 2: Input has [1,1,1] in row 1, output has it in row 2. So again, moved down.\n\nIn Example 3: Input has some 1s: row 0 has [0,1,0], row 1 has [1,1,0]. Output: row 1 has [0,1,0], row 2 has [1,1,0]. So the pattern from row 0 and 1 moved down to row 1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 4: Input has [0,2,2] in row 0? Wait, input is [[0,2,2],[0,0,2],[0,0,0]], so row 0: [0,2,2], row 1: [0,0,2], row 2: [0,0,0]. Output: [[0,0,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,2]], so row 1 has [0,2,2] which was row 0, and row 2 has [0,0,2] which was row 1. So again, everything shifted down by one row.\n\nBut in the shifting, what about the bottom row? In all cases, the bottom row of input becomes all zeros in output, or something is added.\n\nIn Example 1: Input bottom row is [0,0,0], output bottom row is [0,0,0] – same.\n\nIn Example 2: Input bottom row is [0,0,0], output bottom row is [1,1,1] – no, output has [1,1,1] in row 2, which was row 1 in input? Input row 1 is [1,1,1], output row 2 is [1,1,1], so shifted down.\n\nBut in terms of the grid, it seems like the entire grid is shifted downward, and the top row becomes all zeros or something.\n\nLet's think in terms of rows.\n\nPerhaps it's a vertical shift down by one row. But in the output, the top row is always all zeros in these examples.\n\nIn Example 1 output: top row [0,0,0]\n\nExample 2 output: top row [0,0,0]\n\nExample 3 output: top row [0,0,0]\n\nExample 4 output: top row [0,0,0]\n\nAnd the content is shifted down.\n\nBut in Example 3 input: [[0,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0]] – row 0 and 1 have data, row 2 is zero.\n\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,0]] – so row 1 of output is row 0 of input, but row 0 of input is [0,1,0], and output row 1 is [0,1,0], yes. Output row 2 is [1,1,0], which is row 1 of input.\n\nInput row 1 is [1,1,0], output row 2 is [1,1,0], yes.\n\nAnd output row 0 is all zeros.\n\nSimilarly for Example 4.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: shift all rows down by one, and the new top row is all zeros. But in the shifting, the bottom row of input is lost or becomes the new bottom, but in Example 2, input bottom row is [0,0,0], output bottom row is [1,1,1], which is from input row 1.\n\nActually, it's like the grid is shifted down, and the top is filled with zeros.\n\nBut let's confirm with the values.\n\nAnother thing: the numbers are consistent; 1s and 2s are preserved, just moved.\n\nIn Example 4, there are 2s, and they are shifted down.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row i in input, it becomes row i+1 in output, and row 0 in output is all zeros.\n\nBut in a 3x3 grid, rows are 0,1,2.\n\nInput row 0 -> output row 1\n\nInput row 1 -> output row 2\n\nInput row 2 -> what? In output, row 2 is from input row 1 in some cases, but in Example 1, input row 2 is [0,0,0], output row 2 is [0,0,0] – same, but it was shifted from row 1? No.\n\nLet's index the rows.\n\nDefine rows from top to bottom: row 0, row 1, row 2.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput: row0: [1,1,1], row1: [0,0,0], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput: row0: [0,0,0], row1: [1,1,1], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nSo, output row1 is input row0.\n\nOutput row2 is input row1? Input row1 is [0,0,0], output row2 is [0,0,0], yes.\n\nBut output row0 is new zeros.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput: row0: [0,0,0], row1: [1,1,1], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput: row0: [0,0,0], row1: [0,0,0], row2: [1,1,1]\n\nSo, output row2 is input row1.\n\nOutput row1 is input row0? Input row0 is [0,0,0], output row1 is [0,0,0], yes.\n\nOutput row0 is zeros.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput: row0: [0,1,0], row1: [1,1,0], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput: row0: [0,0,0], row1: [0,1,0], row2: [1,1,0]\n\nSo, output row1 is input row0.\n\nOutput row2 is input row1.\n\nOutput row0 is zeros.\n\nInput row2 is [0,0,0], and it's not directly used, but in output, row2 is from input row1, so input row2 is lost or overwritten.\n\nSimilarly in Example 4:\n\nInput: row0: [0,2,2], row1: [0,0,2], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput: row0: [0,0,0], row1: [0,2,2], row2: [0,0,2]\n\nSo, output row1 is input row0.\n\nOutput row2 is input row1.\n\nOutput row0 is zeros.\n\nInput row2 is [0,0,0], and in output, it's not present; instead, output row2 is input row1.\n\nSo the pattern is: the output grid is formed by shifting the input rows down by one, meaning row i of input becomes row i+1 of output for i=0,1, and row 0 of output is all zeros. Since it's a 3x3 grid, row 2 of input is not used or discarded.\n\nIn other words, for a grid of size n x m (here 3x3), the transformation is:\n\nOutput row 0: all zeros\n\nOutput row i: input row i-1 for i=1 to n-1\n\nIn this case, n=3, so output row 0: zeros\n\nOutput row 1: input row 0\n\nOutput row 2: input row 1\n\nInput row 2 is ignored.\n\nIn all training examples, input row 2 is all zeros or has data, but in output, it's replaced by input row 1.\n\nIn Example 2, input row 2 is [0,0,0], output row 2 is [1,1,1] from input row 1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 4, input row 2 is [0,0,0], output row 2 is [0,0,2] from input row 1.\n\nSo yes, input row 2 is not used; it's overwritten.\n\nNow, for the test cases.\n\nThere are two test cases.\n\nTest 1 Input: [[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nSo, row0: [2,0,0], row1: [2,0,0], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nApplying the pattern:\n\nOutput row0: all zeros, so [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row1: input row0, which is [2,0,0]\n\nOutput row2: input row1, which is [2,0,0]\n\nSo output should be: [[0,0,0],[2,0,0],[2,0,0]]\n\nNow, Test 2 Input: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nRow0: [0,0,0], row1: [0,1,0], row2: [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row0: [0,0,0] (zeros)\n\nOutput row1: input row0, which is [0,0,0]\n\nOutput row2: input row1, which is [0,1,0]\n\nSo output should be: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]]\n\nI should verify if this matches the training examples.\n\nIn training, when input has all zeros in some rows, it works, like in Example 2 input row0 is zeros, output row1 is zeros.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nAlso, in Test 2, input row0 is zeros, so output row1 is zeros, which is fine.\n\nNow, the JSON structure.\n\nSince there are two test cases, I need to set \"multiplePredictedOutputs\": true\n\nAnd then \"predictedOutput1\" for first test, \"predictedOutput2\" for second test.\n\n\"predictedOutput\" should be empty array.\n\nAlso, \"predictedOutput3\" should be empty array since only two tests.\n\nNow, for the reasoning fields.\n\nI need to provide:\n\n- solvingStrategy: my complete reasoning\n\n- keySteps: step-by-step analysis\n\n- patternDescription: the transformation rules\n\n- hints: key insights\n\n- confidence: I'm pretty sure, say 100\n\nFirst, patternDescription: The transformation shifts all rows of the input grid down by one position. The top row of the output is always all zeros. Specifically, for a 3x3 grid, output row 0 is [0,0,0], output row 1 is input row 0, and output row 2 is input row 1. The input row 2 is discarded.\n\nSolvingStrategy: I examined each training example and noticed that in each case, the non-zero elements are moved down by one row, and the top row becomes zeros. This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the values (1 or 2).\n\nKeySteps: \n\n1. Compared input and output of Example 1: input row 0 moves to output row 1, output row 0 is zeros.\n\n2. Same for Example 2: input row 1 moves to output row 2, output row 0 and 1 are zeros or shifted.\n\n3. Example 3 and 4 confirm the pattern: input row i becomes output row i+1 for i=0,1, output row 0 is zeros.\n\n4.
