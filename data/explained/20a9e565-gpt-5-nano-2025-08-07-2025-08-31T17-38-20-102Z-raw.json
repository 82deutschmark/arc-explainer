  "solvingStrategy": "Attempted to infer a consistent transformation across all training examples. Observed that outputs tend to compress or extract a simplified representation of the nonzero region in the input grid, often forming a small, regular pattern (e.g., a border-filled rectangle, or a tiled motif) using specific colors that appear near the nonzero content. However, the exact rule for color choice, exact dimensions, and arrangement varies between examples and is not obvious from the given data. I could not establish a reliable, generalizable mapping to apply to the test case with confidence.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Step 1: Examine Example 1 input and output. Noted a compact 3x6 pattern with a border of color 2 and interior zeros, suggesting extraction of a bounding-like shape around nonzero content.",
    "Step 2: Examine Example 2 input and output. Output is a sequence of 2-element rows forming a vertical list; pattern unclear in spatial terms but indicates some form of linearization or extraction of a motif.",
    "Step 3: Examine Example 3 input and output. Output consists of repeated 3-wide blocks with border color 7 and holes in the center, implying tiling or repeated motif extraction.",
    "Step 4: Compared across examples to seek a single rule (e.g., compute bounding box of nonzeros and render a border of a chosen color). Inconsistent color choices and dimensions across examples prevent definitive generalization.",
    "Step 5: Attempted to apply hypothesized rules to the test case but could not derive a robust, reliable prediction due to insufficient pattern clarity."

  "patternDescription": "The training examples appear to transform a large input grid containing scattered nonzero values into a much smaller grid that captures a spatial silhouette or motif derived from those nonzeros. The output tends to emphasize borders or tiles around the nonzero regions, sometimes using colors associated with the content. However, the exact criteria for color choice, placement, and dimensions are inconsistent, making a single definitive rule indeterminable from the given samples.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm 1 (best): Identify all nonzero cells, compute their bounding box, extract a minimal representation that emphasizes the perimeter (e.g., border fill with a color present in the region), and shrink to a standard motif size (e.g., 3xN or NxM) seen in examples.",
    "Algorithm 2 (math): Compute min/max row/col of nonzeros; create a new grid with height = 3 and width = maxCol - minCol + 1, fill top and bottom rows with a chosen color, fill leftmost column with that color, interior zeros.",
    "Algorithm 3 (emojis): ðŸŸ¦ border around central content, ðŸŸ© inner zeros, ðŸŸ¥ color = dominant nonzero value or a fixed mapping from observed colors to border color."
