    "solvingStrategy": "The puzzle involves extracting specific shapes or patterns from a larger grid and placing them into a smaller grid. In the training examples, the output grids contain distinct patterns that are present in the input grids but are isolated and centered.",
    "keySteps": [
      "Initially, I considered that the output might be a random selection of shapes from the input, but this was inconsistent with the outputs provided.",
      "Next, I noticed that the output grids contained patterns that were present in the input grids but were isolated and centered. This led me to hypothesize that the transformation involved finding specific patterns in the input and then creating a new grid with just those patterns.",
      "In Example 1, the output contains a 6x2 grid with a pattern of 2s and 5s. This pattern is found in the bottom-right corner of the input grid.",
      "In Example 2, the output contains a 18x2 grid with a repeating pattern of 7s, 2s, and 3s. This pattern is found in the middle section of the input grid.",
      "For the test cases, I applied the same logic. In Test 1, the pattern of 3s is found in the top-right corner of the input grid. In Test 2, the pattern of 2s is found in the top-left corner, and the pattern of 5s is found near the bottom-right corner."
