  "solvingStrategy": "1) Observe that each input is a 3x9 grid partitioned into three contiguous 3-column blocks. The output is a 3x9 grid where each 3-column block is filled uniformly with a single color, and the three output rows are identical (the same block colors repeated across all rows). 2) For each training example, inspect each 3x3 block (3 rows x 3 columns) of the input and determine a mapping from the pattern of 5s inside that 3x3 to the output color placed in that block. 3) Categorize blocks by the count and arrangement of 5s: blocks with 8 fives → color 3, blocks with a single five → color 4, blocks with a full top row of fives → color 6, blocks with a full bottom row of fives → color 1, blocks with three fives arranged one-per-row in a diagonal/offset pattern → color 9. 4) Apply this mapping to each 3-column block in the test input, then build the output by repeating the determined block colors across all three output rows.",

  "patternDescription": "The 3x9 input is treated as three adjacent 3x3 blocks. Each block's pattern of 5s determines a single color that fills that entire block in the output. Specific mappings observed: - 8 cells with 5 (almost full block) -> color 3. - Exactly 1 cell with 5 -> color 4. - Top row of the 3x3 is all 5s (other rows empty) -> color 6. - Bottom row all 5s -> color 1. - Exactly three 5s arranged one per row (diagonal/offset) -> color 9.

Fill that block with the chosen color and repeat across all 3 output rows.",
    "Mathematical/description hint: Partition the 3x9 grid into three 3x3 matrices. Let s be the count of cells equal to 5. Use s and the positions of the 5s to map to a color: s=8→3, s=1→4. For s=3, examine which rows contain the three 5s: top→6, bottom→1, one-per-row (diagonal)→9.",
