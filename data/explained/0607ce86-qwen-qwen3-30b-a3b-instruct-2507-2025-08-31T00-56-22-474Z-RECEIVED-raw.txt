  "solvingStrategy": "Analyze each training example to identify the transformation pattern. In all examples, the output is a cleaned version of the input where: 1. All non-zero values are preserved only if they belong to a consistent block pattern (e.g., 2x2 or larger rectangles of same number). 2. Irregular or isolated non-zero values (like single 3s or 8s in inconsistent positions) are replaced with 0. 3. The structure of repeated blocks (e.g., 2,2,8,2,2 or 3,3,8,3,3) is preserved only when they form a consistent, repeating pattern across rows and columns. 4. The transformation appears to be a 'pattern completion' or 'noise removal' where only the most consistent, repeated rectangular blocks are kept, and any deviation (e.g., a 3 in the middle of a block of 2s or 8s) is corrected to match the dominant block. 5. In Example 1, the 3s inside 8-blocks are removed and replaced with 8s. 6. In Example 2, the 3s and 1s that break the pattern are replaced with 2s or 3s to complete the block. 7. In Example 3, the 1s and 2s that are inconsistent are replaced with the dominant block value (3 or 2). 8. The test case shows similar patterns: blocks of 2,2,8,2,2 and 3,3,8,3,3 are repeated. Any 3s or 8s that are not part of a consistent block (e.g., isolated 3s in the middle of 2-blocks) are replaced with the dominant block value. 9. The output is generated by scanning each block and replacing any inconsistent values with the majority value in that block. 10. The transformation is not geometric (no rotation/reflection), but rather a logical cleanup of inconsistent values within repeating blocks.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Step 1: Observe that in all training examples, the output has fewer non-zero values than input, suggesting noise removal.",
    "Step 2: Identify recurring block patterns: e.g., 2,2,8,2,2 or 3,3,8,3,3 in columns 1-5 and 8-12.",
    "Step 3: Notice that isolated or inconsistent values (like a 3 in a 2-block) are replaced with the dominant block value.",
    "Step 4: In Example 1, the 3s inside 8-blocks are replaced with 8s.",
    "Step 5: In Example 2, the 1s and 3s that break the 2,3 pattern are replaced with 2s and 3s to complete the block.",
    "Step 6: In Example 3, the 1s and 2s that are not part of the 3-block are replaced with 3s.",
    "Step 7: Apply the same logic to the test case: identify blocks of 2,2,8,2,2 and 3,3,8,3,3.",
    "Step 8: Replace any non-8, non-2, non-3 values that break the block pattern with the dominant value.",
    "Step 9: Specifically, in row 1, column 13: input has 3 in a 2-block → replace with 2.",
    "Step 10: In row 1, column 16: input has 3 in a 2-block → replace with 2.",
    "Step 11: In row 4, column 13: input has 3 in a 8-block → replace with 8.",
    "Step 12: In row 11, column 6: input has 3 in an 8-block → replace with 8.",
    "Step 13: In row 12, column 4: input has 3 in an 8-block → replace with 8.",
    "Step 14: In row 18, column 1: input has 3 in an 8-block → replace with 8.",
    "Step 15: In row 19, column 1: input has 3 in an 8-block → replace with 8.",
    "Step 16: All other values are already consistent or zero.",
    "Step 17: Output is generated by applying these replacements to the input grid."

  "patternDescription": "The transformation removes inconsistent non-zero values within repeating rectangular blocks. Blocks of 2,2,8,2,2 and 3,3,8,3,3 are preserved.

The output is a 'cleaned' version of the input where only the most consistent block patterns remain.",
