Let's analyze the examples to find the mapping.\\n\\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 5s in positions that correspond to the output having 3s, 4s, and 9s. Similarly, in Example 2, the 5s are replaced with 9s, 1s, and 4s. The pattern seems to be that each group of connected 5s (horizontally or vertically) is assigned a unique number. The numbers are assigned in the order the groups appear when scanning the grid from top-left to bottom-right. For each group, the number is determined by the sum of the positions of the group's first occurrence in the grid, modulo 9, plus 1. For example, the first group in Example 1 starts at (0,0), sum 0, mod 9 +1 gives 1, but in the output, it's 3. This suggests a different approach. Alternatively, the numbers assigned to each group are sequential, starting from the smallest available number not used in previous groups. However, looking at the outputs, the numbers vary. Wait, in all examples, the output is a 3x3 grid where each row is the same, and the numbers are in the order of the groups found. For example, in Example 1, the groups are in the left, middle, and right parts, so the output is [3,3,3], [4,4,4], [9,9,9]. Wait, but how are these numbers determined? Let me check the outputs again. In Example 1, the output is all 3s, 4s, and 9s. Wait, no, the output is a 3x3 grid where each row is [3,3,3,4,4,4,9,9,9], but the input is 3x9. Wait, the input is a 3x9 grid, and the output is also a 3x9 grid. Each group of 5s in the input is replaced by a unique number across the entire grid. For example, in Example 1, the first group of 5s (the top-left block) is replaced by 3, the middle group by 4, and the rightmost group by 9. In Example 2, the groups are replaced by 9, 1, and 4. The numbers seem to be assigned based on the order of the groups when scanning the grid row-wise. But how exactly? Let me look for a pattern in the numbers. For Example 1, the groups are assigned 3,4,9. In Example 2, they are 9,1,4. Maybe the numbers are determined by the position of the first occurrence of the group. For instance, take the first group's coordinates (row, column), sum them, and then take modulo 9, then add 1. Let's test this. In Example 1, the first group starts at (0,0), sum 0, mod 9 +1 =1. But the output is 3. Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned in a sequence starting from 1, but each example uses a different starting point. Alternatively, the numbers are determined by the number of 5s in each group. Let's check. In Example 1, the first group has 5s in positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). That's 8 5s. The second group is at (1,4), (1,6), (2,6). Wait, no, looking at the input for Example 1: the input is [[5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5], [5,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0], [5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0,0]]. So the first group is the left 3x3 block of 5s (except for the middle 0). Then there's a 5 at (0,8), then another group at (2,6). Wait, maybe I need to count connected components. Alternatively, the groups are determined by contiguous 5s (horizontally or vertically). So in Example 1, there are three separate groups: the left block, the middle 5 at (1,4), and the right 5s at (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (2,6). Wait, no. Let me parse the input for Example 1 again. The input is a 3x9 grid. Let me write it out:\\nRow 0: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5\\nRow 1: 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0\\nRow 2: 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0\\nSo the first group is the left 3x3 block (positions (0,0-2), (1,0,2), (2,0-2)), except for (1,1) which is 0. Then there's a 5 at (0,8), then another group at (1,4), and another group at (1,6), (1,7), (2,6). Wait, maybe the groups are not connected. Alternatively, the groups are all the 5s in the input, and each is replaced by a unique number. But how are the numbers assigned? The output for Example 1 is all 3s, 4s, and 9s. Wait, looking at the output: each row is [3,3,3,4,4,4,9,9,9]. So the first three columns are 3, next three are 4, last three are 9. So the groups are the left block (columns 0-2), the middle block (columns 3-5), and the right block (columns 6-8). But in the input, the middle block has a 5 at (1,4), which is part of the middle columns. Wait, maybe the groups are determined by the columns they occupy. For example, the left group is columns 0-2, the middle is columns 3-5 (even if there's only one 5), and the right is columns 6-8. Then each group is assigned a number based on the order of the columns. But how are the numbers determined? Let's look at the outputs. In Example 1, the left group is 3, middle 4, right 9. In Example 2, the input is [[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],[5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0]]. The output is [[9,9,9,1,1,1,4,4,4],...]. So the leftmost group is at (0,2), (1,1), (1,7), (2,0), (2,3-5). Wait, maybe the groups are not contiguous. Alternatively, the groups are all the 5s, and each is assigned a number based on their position. But how? Alternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the order in which the groups are encountered when scanning the grid row by row, left to right. For example, in Example 1, the first group encountered is the left block, then the middle 5 at (1,4), then the right 5s. But in the output, the middle group is assigned 4, which is between 3 and 9. Wait, maybe the groups are ordered by their minimum row index, then minimum column index. Let's try to label the groups in each example and see the numbers assigned. For Example 1, the groups are:\\nGroup 1: positions in the left block (columns 0-2)\\nGroup 2: position (1,4)\\nGroup 3: positions (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (2,6)\\nBut in the output, the numbers are 3,4,9. How are these numbers determined? Maybe the numbers are assigned in the order of the groups, but each group's number is the sum of the row and column of the first occurrence, modulo 9, plus 1. Let's check:\\nGroup 1 first occurrence is (0,0): 0+0=0, mod 9 +1=1. But the output is 3. Hmm. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are assigned in a sequence starting from 1, but each example has a different starting point. Alternatively, the numbers are determined by the number of 5s in each group. Let's count:\\nIn Example 1, Group 1 has 8 5s (since (1,1) is 0). Group 2 has 1 (at (1,4)). Group 3 has 4 (positions (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (2,6)). Then, maybe the numbers are assigned based on the size of the groups. For example, the smallest group gets the smallest number. But in Example 1, the group sizes are 8,1,4. The sorted sizes are 1,4,8. Then assign numbers 1,2,3. But the output numbers are 3,4,9. Not matching. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the position of the group's centroid. But this seems complicated. Let's look at another example. In Example 2, the input has groups at different positions. Let's parse the input for Example 2:\\nRow 0: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\\nRow 2: 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0\\nSo the groups are:\\nGroup 1: (0,2), (1,1), (1,7), (2,0), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\\nGroup 2: (1,4) (but wait, in row 1, column 4 is 0. Wait, the input for Example 2 is:\\n[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0],\\n[0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],\\n[5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0]\\nSo the groups are:\\n- (0,2)\\n- (1,1), (1,7)\\n- (2,0), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\\nSo three groups. The output for Example 2 is all 9s, 1s, and 4s. How are these numbers assigned? Let's see. Maybe the first group (leftmost) is assigned 9, then 1, then 4. But why these numbers? Alternatively, the numbers are determined by the position of the first 5 in the group. For example, the first group's first 5 is at (0,2). Sum is 0+2=2. Mod 9 +1=3. But the output is 9. Not matching. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned in a way that each group's number is the sum of the row and column of the first occurrence, divided by 9, then multiplied by 9. Not sure. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned in a sequence, but each example starts with a different base. For example, in Example 1, the first group is assigned 3, then 4, then 9. Maybe the numbers are assigned in the order of the groups, but each example has a different starting number. But how to determine that? Alternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the number of groups. For example, if there are three groups, assign numbers 3,4,9. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the position of the group's first occurrence in the grid. For example, the first group's first 5 is at (row, column), and the number is (row + column) mod 9 + 1. Let's test this. For Example 1, Group 1's first 5 is at (0,0): 0+0=0 → mod 9 +1=1. But the output is 3. Not matching. For Group 2 in Example 1, first occurrence is (1,4): 1+4=5 → mod 9 +1=6. But the output is 4. Not matching. Hmm. Maybe this approach is not working. Let's look for another pattern. The outputs for all examples are 3x9 grids where each row is the same. The numbers are repeated three times. For example, in Example 1, each row is [3,3,3,4,4,4,9,9,9]. So the output is three blocks of three columns each, each filled with the same number. The numbers correspond to the groups in the input. So the leftmost group in the input is assigned to the first block (columns 0-2), the next group to columns 3-5, and so on. But how are the numbers determined? Let's look at the outputs again. In Example 1, the numbers are 3,4,9. In Example 2, they are 9,1,4. In Example 3, they are 6,3,1. Wait, no. Let me check Example 3's output. The output is [[6,6,6,3,3,3,1,1,1],...]. So the numbers are 6,3,1. In Example 4, the output is [[4,4,4,6,6,6,3,3,3],...]. So the numbers are 4,6,3. How are these numbers determined? Maybe the numbers are assigned based on the order of the groups when sorted by their minimum column index. For example, the leftmost group (smallest column index) gets the first number, the next gets the second, etc. But how are the numbers themselves determined? Let's look at the numbers again. For Example 1: 3,4,9. For Example 2: 9,1,4. For Example 3: 6,3,1. For Example 4: 4,6,3. Maybe the numbers are assigned in a way that each group's number is the sum of the unique numbers in the previous groups plus 1. But this doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned in a sequence starting from 1, but each example has a different starting point. But how to determine that? Alternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the number of 5s in each group. For example, the group with the most 5s gets the highest number. But in Example 1, the group with 8 5s gets 3, which is lower than 9. Not matching. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are assigned in a way that each group's number is the sum of the row and column indices of all 5s in the group, modulo 9, plus 1. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned in a way that each group's number is the sum of the row and column of the first 5 in the group, multiplied by some factor. Not sure. Let's try to find a different approach. The outputs are all rows repeated. So the transformation seems to involve dividing the input into three blocks of three columns each, and assigning a unique number to each block based on the presence of 5s in that block. For example, if a block contains any 5s, it is assigned a specific number. But how are the numbers determined? Let's look at the examples again. In Example 1, the left block (columns 0-2) has 5s, the middle block (columns 3-5) has a 5 at (1,4), and the right block (columns 6-8) has 5s. The output assigns 3 to the left, 4 to the middle, and 9 to the right. In Example 2, the left block has a 5 at (0,2), the middle block has a 5 at (1,4), and the right block has 5s at (1,7) and (2,3-5). Wait, maybe the blocks are determined by the columns, and each block is assigned a number based on the presence of 5s. But how are the numbers determined? Maybe the numbers are assigned in the order of the blocks (left to right), but each example starts with a different base. For example, in Example 1, the left block is assigned 3, middle 4, right 9. In Example 2, left is 9, middle 1, right 4. Maybe the numbers are assigned in a sequence that wraps around. For example, the first block is assigned the next available number in a sequence, but this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, the numbers are assigned based on the number of 5s in each block. For example, the block with the most 5s gets the highest number. Let's check Example 1: left block has 8 5s, middle has 1, right has 4. So the numbers would be 9,1,4. But in Example 1, the numbers are 3,4,9. Not matching. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are assigned based on the position of the first 5 in each block. For example, for each block, find the first 5 in",
