      "Identified that transformed rows set 2 at columns where row0 has 5 (e.g., Example1: row0 5s at cols 0/3/7 → transformed rows set 2s there)",
      "Verified last column (index9) always remains 5 in transformed rows",
      "Confirmed non-transformed rows (no 5 in last column) remain unchanged (all zeros in examples)",
      "Tested hypothesis: For row i>0, if input[i][9]==5, set output[i][j]=2 for all j where input[0][j]==5 (j<9)",
      "Applied rule to test case: row0 has 5s at cols 0/2/3/6/8; rows 2/3/5/7/9 have 5 in last column → set 2s at those columns",
