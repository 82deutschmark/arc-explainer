      "patternDescription": "The transformation involves recognizing the position of the special number 5 (🌍) in each row and then mapping each row to a specific constant number sequence based on where the 5 appears. Essentially, the aliens are encoding a type of spatial-to-symbolic mapping: each row’s pattern of where Earth (🌍) is located determines the entire row’s output number, which corresponds to a particular emoji representing humans (👤), aliens (👽), or their planet (🪐). This is a form of spatial pattern recognition combined with object counting and positional mapping rather than geometric rotation or reflection.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at each row of the input grid and find where the Earth emoji (🌍, number 5) appears. 2. Based on the column where 🌍 is found, assign a fixed output row: \n   - If 🌍 is in the left column, output the row as 2 (👽) emojis.\n   - If 🌍 is in the middle column, output the row as 4 (🪐) emojis.\n   - If 🌍 is in the right column, output the row as 3 (👤) emojis.\n3. Repeat this for each row independently to form the output grid.\n4. If you get confused, switch to thinking about the numbers (0 and 5) as placeholders and focus on the position of 5 rather than the full pattern of 0s.\nThis approach explains why the output rows are uniform in emoji number and differ only by which emoji is repeated.",
      "hints": [
        "The key is to focus on the location of the number 5 (Earth 🌍) in each row, not the zeroes.",
        "Each row’s output is a uniform row of the same emoji, chosen based on the column of the 5 in that row.",
        "The emojis used in the output represent ‘human’, ‘alien’, and ‘their planet’ — likely encoding a communication about identity or location."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to communicate a simple map of relationships or identities based on position: where Earth is located in their view determines how they see us (humans 👤), themselves (aliens 👽), or their home (🪐). It’s like they are saying: 'Depending on where you are (left, middle, right), we label you differently.' This could be a peaceful attempt to classify or understand us spatially, not hostile but more observational and curious.",
