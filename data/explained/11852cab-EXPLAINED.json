        "In Example 2, row 2 (0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0) is duplicated to row 6 (0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0) with similar modifications.",
        "In Example 3, row 3 (0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0) is duplicated to row 4 (0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0) but also to row 1 (0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0) which is more complex.",
        "Looking at the test case, row 2 (0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0) and row 5 (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0) seem to be candidates for duplication. Row 2 has a symmetric pattern with 1s and 4s, and row 5 has 1s.",
        "The pattern suggests that row 2 should be duplicated to row 6 (0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0) which is already present, or row 5 should be duplicated to row 2 which doesn't make sense.",
        "Reconsidering, the pattern might be that the row with the most symmetric elements (row 2) is duplicated to the row that has the same outer elements but missing the middle ones (row 6).",
        "So, row 2 (0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0) should be duplicated to row 6 (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0) but since row 6 already has (0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0), it's more likely that row 2 is duplicated to row 6 with modifications.",
        "Actually, looking more carefully, row 6 (0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0) is duplicated from row 3 (0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0) in the output of Example 2. This suggests that rows with symmetric elements are duplicated vertically.",
        "In the test case, row 2 (0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0) has symmetric 1s and a 4 in the middle. Row 5 (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0) has symmetric 1s but no middle element. The pattern suggests duplicating row 2 to row 6.",
        "Therefore, the output should have row 2 (0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0) duplicated to row 6, replacing (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0) with (0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0)."

Specifically, if a row has symmetric non-zero elements (like 1,0,4,0,1), it is duplicated to another row that has the same outer elements but missing the middle ones, effectively completing the symmetric pattern vertically.",
