  "solvingStrategy": "First, I examined the training examples to identify the transformation pattern. Each output is a compacted representation of a repeating block or motif found in the lower part of the input grid. The outputs are always rectangular, and their content matches the most prominent or repeated motif in the input, ignoring the background and other colors. For each color block (e.g., 2, 4, 7, 9, 3), the output is a 3x3 or 3x6 (or similar) grid that captures the motif's structure. For the test cases, I searched for the largest, most prominent colored block patterns in the lower part of the input, extracted their motif, and formatted them as a compact output grid, matching the style of the training outputs.",
