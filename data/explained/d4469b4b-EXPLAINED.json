      "patternDescription": "The big picture is: the input grid always contains only two colours – black (background) and one single coloured pixel.  That colour acts like a ‘code-word’.  We completely ignore where the coloured pixels are placed.  We only look at **which** colour it is.  Each colour has a fixed 3×3 ‘symbol’ made of Earth-pixels (🌍) that we must output:\n• colour ✅(1)  →  a PLUS sign\n• colour 👽(2) →  a T sign\n• colour 👤(3) →  an L sign\nThe output grid is always the same 3×3 size, uses only ⬛ and 🌍, and shows the symbol that belongs to the detected colour.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. (If helpful, translate the emojis back to numbers so you can see the pattern the aliens used.)\n2. Scan the 5×5 input and find the one colour that is not black ⬛ (there is only one).\n3. Use this simple look-up table:\n   • If the colour is ✅(1) draw\n     ⬛🌍⬛\n     🌍🌍🌍\n     ⬛🌍⬛\n   • If the colour is 👽(2) draw\n     🌍🌍🌍\n     ⬛🌍⬛\n     ⬛🌍⬛\n   • If the colour is 👤(3) draw\n     ⬛⬛🌍\n     ⬛⬛🌍\n     🌍🌍🌍\n4. Put ⬛ everywhere else so the picture is exactly 3 rows by 3 columns.\n5. For the test puzzle the only non-black colour is 👤(3), so we output the L sign, giving exactly the provided answer.",

      "alienMeaning": "It feels like the aliens are sending a very small dictionary: a plus (🌍 cross) means ‘Option 1’, a T means ‘Option 2’, and an L means ‘Option 3’.  Because the test grid contained the ‘human’ colour 👤 and produced the L, they may be saying: ‘When we talk about humans, choose option 3.’  It sounds more instructive than hostile – more like handing us a legend for reading future messages.",
