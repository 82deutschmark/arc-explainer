  "solvingStrategy": "- Recognize the 9-column grid is partitioned into three 3x3 blocks horizontally. The input uses color 5 to draw a small glyph within each 3x3 block. The output replaces each 3x3 block with a solid-color 3x3 block (replicated across all 3 output rows) whose color is determined by the glyph type detected in that block.\n- From the training pairs, deduce the mapping of specific 3x3 glyphs to output colors:\n  • Ring (all border cells on, center off) -> 3\n  • Center dot (only middle cell on) -> 4\n  • Anti-diagonal (bottom-left to top-right) -> 9\n  • Bottom horizontal row on -> 1\n  • Top horizontal row on -> 6\n- Apply this mapping to each 3x3 block of the test input, then construct the output as three identical rows of the three chosen colors repeated across each 3-column block.",

    "Parse the test input’s blocks: A(1-3)=bottom row ->1, B(4-6)=anti-diagonal ->9, C(7-9)=top row ->6.",

  "patternDescription": "Each 9x3 input is three adjacent 3x3 symbol blocks drawn with color 5. Replace each 3x3 block by a uniform-color 3x3 block whose color encodes which symbol is present: ring=3, center dot=4, anti-diagonal=9, bottom row=1, top row=6. The output consists of three identical rows concatenating the three colors across the blocks.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithmic: For each block b in {1..3}: extract 3x3 subgrid; classify glyph by matching against templates {ring, center, antiDiag, bottomRow, topRow}; map class via dict {ring:3, center:4, antiDiag:9, bottomRow:1, topRow:6}; fill output columns (3b-2..3b) with that color on all rows.",
    "Descriptive/Math: Partition into three 3x3 matrices Bi. Define indicator sets Sring, Scenter, Santi, Sbottom, Stop for cell coordinates. If Bi matches one set exactly, assign ci ∈ {3,4,9,1,6} respectively, and set output O[:,3i-2..3i]=ci.",
