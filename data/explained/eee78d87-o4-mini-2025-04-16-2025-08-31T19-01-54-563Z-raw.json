For the test, I identified the shape mask of the value 2 in the 6√ó6 input (four corner points of a 3√ó3 box), assumed the same tiling scheme (block size‚Ää=‚Ää4, blocks‚Ää=‚Ää4√ó4), and overlaid the 3√ó3 mask (centered) in the four central blocks at color 9, filling the rest with a simplified horizontal‚Äêbar background (rows local 1‚Äì2 filled with background color 7, other cells zero).",
