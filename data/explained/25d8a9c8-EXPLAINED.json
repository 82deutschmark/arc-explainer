          "Initially, I considered that the transformation might involve some form of arithmetic operation or color replacement but found no consistent pattern.",
          "Upon closer inspection, I noticed that in Example 1, the first row contains 4s, so it was transformed into 5s, and the other rows were transformed into 0s.",
          "In Example 2, the second row contains 6s, but since there are no 4s in this row, it was transformed into 5s, and the other rows were transformed into 0s. This suggested that the presence of 4s in a row or column is crucial.",
          "Example 3 confirmed this hypothesis as the second row contains 4s and was transformed into 5s, while the other rows were transformed into 0s.",
          "Example 4 further supported the idea that rows or columns containing 4s are transformed into 5s, and others into 0s.",
          "Applying this pattern to the test case, the first and third rows contain 4s and 8s respectively, so they should be transformed into 5s, while the middle row does not contain 4s and should be transformed into 0s."
