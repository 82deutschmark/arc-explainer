      "reasoningLog": "We are given three training examples and one test case. Each input and output is a 4x4 grid of numbers (0-4). The goal is to understand the transformation from input to output and explain it simply.\n\nFirst, let's look at the training examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[0,4,2,3], [4,1,0,2], [0,3,4,0], [3,0,1,4]]\nOutput: [[1,4,2,3], [4,1,3,2], [2,3,4,1], [3,2,1,4]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[1,0,3,4], [0,0,2,1], [2,1,4,0], [0,3,1,2]]\nOutput: [[1,2,3,4], [3,4,2,1], [2,1,4,3], [4,3,1,2]]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [[3,0,2,1], [1,0,0,0], [4,3,0,2], [0,1,4,3]]\nOutput: [[3,4,2,1], [1,2,3,4], [4,3,1,2], [2,1,4,3]]\n\nTest Case:\nInput: [[0,1,2,3], [0,3,1,0], [3,0,4,1], [0,4,0,2]]\nCorrect Answer: [[4,1,2,3], [2,3,1,4], [3,2,4,1], [1,4,3,2]]\n\nWe note that the numbers are in the range 0-4. Also, note that the emoji mapping is given, but the puzzle is about numbers. However, the user sees emojis. But the transformation is on the numbers.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern:\n\nObserving the examples, it seems that the output grid is a Latin square (each row and each column has each number from 1 to 4 exactly once) but note that the input may have 0s and the output has no 0s? Actually, in the outputs, we see numbers 1 to 4. Also, in the inputs, we have 0s which are like missing or placeholder.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has 0s, output has no 0s and is a Latin square.\n\nSimilarly, Example 2 and 3 outputs are Latin squares of 4x4 with numbers 1 to 4.\n\nNow, what about the input? In Example 1 input:\nRow0: [0,4,2,3] -> becomes [1,4,2,3] in output. So 0 was replaced by 1.\nRow1: [4,1,0,2] -> [4,1,3,2] -> 0 replaced by 3.\nRow2: [0,3,4,0] -> [2,3,4,1] -> first 0 becomes 2, second 0 becomes 1.\nRow3: [3,0,1,4] -> [3,2,1,4] -> 0 becomes 2.\n\nBut the replacements are not arbitrary. The entire grid must form a Latin square.\n\nSo the transformation is: fill in the zeros so that the grid becomes a Latin square (each row and each column has each of 1,2,3,4 exactly once).\n\nBut is that the only rule? Because in the examples, the non-zero numbers are already in place and we only replace the zeros? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1 input:\nRow0: 0,4,2,3 -> non-zero: 4,2,3. So we need to put 1 in the 0 position? But in the output it is 1. Similarly, row1: 4,1,0,2 -> non-zero:4,1,2 -> missing 3, so 0 becomes 3. Row2: 0,3,4,0 -> non-zero:3,4 -> missing 1 and 2. But in output we have 2 and 1 in the zero positions? How? The row must have 1,2,3,4. So the two zeros must be filled with 1 and 2. But which one where? Similarly for columns.\n\nSo we must have the entire grid satisfying the Latin square constraint.\n\nBut let's see the non-zero numbers: they are fixed? Actually, in the input, the non-zero numbers are already placed and we cannot change them? So we must fill the zeros without changing the non-zeros.\n\nTherefore, the problem is: given a 4x4 grid with some zeros (which are placeholders) and the rest numbers 1 to 4 (but note that in the input we have 4, which is allowed), we must replace the zeros with numbers from 1 to 4 such that every row and every column contains each number from 1 to 4 exactly once.\n\nBut wait, in the grid, we have numbers 0 and then 1-4. In the output, we have only 1-4. So yes, the zeros are to be replaced.\n\nNow, let's check if the non-zero numbers are fixed and we can't change them. In all examples, the non-zero numbers in the input are the same in the output? \n\nExample 1:\nInput row0: [0,4,2,3] -> output: [1,4,2,3] -> non-zero numbers 4,2,3 remain the same? Yes, and 0 becomes 1.\nRow1: [4,1,0,2] -> [4,1,3,2] -> 4,1,2 remain, 0 becomes 3.\nRow2: [0,3,4,0] -> [2,3,4,1] -> 3 and 4 remain, and the two zeros become 2 and 1? But note: in input row2, the two zeros are at position0 and position3. In output, position0 is 2 and position3 is 1. So the non-zero numbers (3 and 4) are unchanged, and zeros are filled.\n\nSimilarly, row3: [3,0,1,4] -> [3,2,1,4] -> unchanged except 0 becomes 2.\n\nBut now, we also have to check the columns. For example, column0 in input: [0,4,0,3] -> output: [1,4,2,3] so column0: [1,4,2,3] which has 1,2,3,4? Yes, each number once.\n\nIn input column0: [0,4,0,3] -> so we have 4 and 3, and two zeros. In output, we have 1 and 2 in the zero positions.\n\nSo the rule is: replace each zero with a number from 1 to 4 such that each row and each column has all distinct numbers 1 to 4.\n\nBut note: the non-zero numbers are fixed and must not be changed.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2:\n\nInput: [[1,0,3,4], [0,0,2,1], [2,1,4,0], [0,3,1,2]]\nOutput: [[1,2,3,4], [3,4,2,1], [2,1,4,3], [4,3,1,2]]\n\nIn row0: input [1,0,3,4] -> output [1,2,3,4] -> 0 becomes 2, non-zero unchanged.\nRow1: [0,0,2,1] -> [3,4,2,1] -> zeros become 3 and 4? But which one? In the output, the first zero (position0) becomes 3, the second (position1) becomes 4? But we must also check columns.\n\nColumn0: input [1,0,2,0] -> output [1,3,2,4] -> so the two zeros become 3 and 4? Specifically, row1 col0 becomes 3 and row3 col0 becomes 4? Because in output row1 col0 is 3 and row3 col0 is 4.\n\nSimilarly, for row1, the two zeros are at col0 and col1. In output, they are 3 and 4.\n\nNow, Example 3:\n\nInput: [[3,0,2,1], [1,0,0,0], [4,3,0,2], [0,1,4,3]]\nOutput: [[3,4,2,1], [1,2,3,4], [4,3,1,2], [2,1,4,3]]\n\nRow0: [3,0,2,1] -> [3,4,2,1] -> 0 becomes 4.\nRow1: [1,0,0,0] -> [1,2,3,4] -> zeros become 2,3,4? Specifically, in output: col1=2, col2=3, col3=4.\nRow2: [4,3,0,2] -> [4,3,1,2] -> 0 becomes 1.\nRow3: [0,1,4,3] -> [2,1,4,3] -> 0 becomes 2.\n\nNow, columns: column0: input [3,1,4,0] -> output [3,1,4,2] -> 0 becomes 2.\nColumn1: [0,0,3,1] -> output [4,2,3,1] -> so the two zeros become 4 and 2? Specifically, row0 col1 becomes 4 and row1 col1 becomes 2? Because output row0 col1 is 4 and row1 col1 is 2.\n\nSo the pattern is consistent: we must fill the zeros to complete the Latin square without changing the non-zero entries.\n\nNow, for the test case:\n\nInput: [[0,1,2,3], [0,3,1,0], [3,0,4,1], [0,4,0,2]]\nWe need to replace the zeros so that each row and each column has 1,2,3,4.\n\nLet's denote the grid:\n\nRow0: [0,1,2,3] -> non-zero: 1,2,3 -> missing 4? So the zero must become 4? Then row0 would be [4,1,2,3]. That matches the first row of the correct answer.\n\nRow1: [0,3,1,0] -> non-zero: 3,1 -> missing 2 and 4. So the two zeros must be 2 and 4? But we have to assign them without conflict.\n\nRow2: [3,0,4,1] -> non-zero: 3,4,1 -> missing 2? So the zero must become 2? Then row2: [3,2,4,1]. That matches the third row of the correct answer.\n\nRow3: [0,4,0,2] -> non-zero: 4,2 -> missing 1 and 3? So zeros become 1 and 3.\n\nNow, let's assign:\n\nRow0: [4,1,2,3] -> fixed.\n\nRow1: We have two zeros at col0 and col3. We need to put 2 and 4? But which one where?\n\nSimilarly, row3: zeros at col0 and col2. We need to put 1 and 3.\n\nNow, check columns:\n\nColumn0: currently has row0:4, row1:0, row2:3, row3:0 -> so the two zeros must be filled with the missing numbers. The existing numbers: 4 and 3. So missing 1 and 2? But we need each column to have 1,2,3,4. So column0 must have 1,2,3,4. Currently, row0:4, row2:3, so we have 4 and 3. Missing 1 and 2. So the zeros in row1 col0 and row3 col0 must be 1 and 2? But we have two positions: row1 col0 and row3 col0.\n\nSimilarly, column1: row0:1, row1:3, row2:? (we have row2 col1: in row2 we have [3,2,4,1] so col1 is 2? But row2 col1 was 0 and we set it to 2? Then column1: row0:1, row1:3, row2:2, row3:4 (from input row3 col1 is 4). So [1,3,2,4] -> that's 1,2,3,4? Yes.\n\nBut we haven't set row1 and row3 yet.\n\nColumn1: already set? Row0 col1:1, row1 col1:3 (fixed, because non-zero), row2 col1:2 (we set that in row2), row3 col1:4 (fixed). So column1: [1,3,2,4] -> distinct? Yes.\n\nColumn2: row0:2 (fixed), row1:1 (fixed), row2:4 (fixed), row3:0 (to be filled). So currently: 2,1,4, and one missing. The missing number is 3? Because 1,2,4 are present. So row3 col2 must be 3? Then column2: [2,1,4,3] -> distinct.\n\nThen row3: [0,4,3,2] -> but we have row3: [0,4,0,2] -> we set col2 to 3, so now row3: [0,4,3,2]. Then the zero at col0 must be? We need row3 to have 1,2,3,4? Currently: 0 (to be filled), 4,3,2 -> so we have 4,3,2 -> missing 1. So the zero at col0 must be 1? Then row3: [1,4,3,2].\n\nNow, row1: [0,3,1,0] -> we have set nothing yet? But we know row1 must have 2 and 4? And we have two zeros at col0 and col3.\n\nNow, column0: row0:4, row1:0 (to be filled), row2:3, row3:1 (we set row3 col0 to 1). So column0: [4, ?, 3, 1]. We need 1,2,3,4? We have 4,3,1 -> missing 2. So the ? (row1 col0) must be 2? Then column0: [4,2,3,1] -> distinct.\n\nThen row1: we set col0 to 2, so row1: [2,3,1,0] -> then the last zero at col3 must be 4? Because row1 must have 1,2,3,4? Currently: 2,3,1 -> missing 4. So set to 4? Then row1: [2,3,1,4].\n\nNow, check column3: row0:3, row1:4, row2:1 (from row2: [3,2,4,1] so col3=1), row3:2 (from row3: [1,4,3,2] so col3=2). Then column3: [3,4,1,2] -> distinct? Yes.\n\nSo the completed grid is:\nRow0: [4,1,2,3]\nRow1: [2,3,1,4]\nRow2: [3,2,4,1]\nRow3: [1,4,3,2]\n\nWhich exactly matches the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is: complete the Latin square by replacing zeros with numbers 1 to 4, without changing the non-zero entries, so that each row and each column has each of 1,2,3,4 exactly once.\n\nNow, for the explanation:\n\nPatternDescription: The aliens are showing us a grid with some missing pieces (the zeros). We need to fill in the missing pieces so that every row and every column has each of the four symbols exactly once. It's like a Sudoku puzzle without the boxes.\n\nSolvingStrategy: \n1. Look at the grid. The non-zero numbers are fixed and cannot be changed. The zeros are placeholders that we must replace with the numbers 1 to 4.\n2. For each row, figure out which numbers are missing (because each row must have 1,2,3,4 exactly once).\n3. For each column, also figure out which numbers are missing.\n4. Then, assign the missing numbers to the zeros in such a way that the row and column constraints are satisfied. You might need to try different possibilities if there are conflicts, but in these puzzles, there is only one solution.\n\nNote: Even though the user sees emojis, the numbers correspond to specific emojis. However, for solving the puzzle, it's easier to think in terms of the numbers (0 to 4) because the transformation is about completing the grid to form a Latin square with symbols 1 to 4. But the emojis are just a representation. So, you can think of the numbers as abstract symbols.\n\nHints:\n- Hint 1: Each row must contain all four symbols (1,2,3,4) without repetition.\n- Hint 2: Each column must also contain all four symbols without repetition.\n- Hint 3: The non-zero entries are fixed. Only the zeros (which are placeholders) need to be filled.\n\nAlienMeaning: The aliens are sending us a grid that we must complete to show harmony and balance. Each row and column having every symbol exactly once might represent a message of unity and cooperation. They are not angry; they are trying to teach us about order and completeness. Specifically, with the emojis: \n- 1: ✅ (positive)\n- 2: 👽 (them)\n- 3: 👤 (us)\n- 4: 🪐 (their home)\nIn the completed grid, every row and column has one of each, meaning that in every aspect (row) and every perspective (column), there is a balance between us and them, positive and their home. This might symbolize a desire for peaceful coexistence and mutual inclusion.\n\nConfidence: I am very confident (95) about the solving strategy because it consistently works for all training examples and the test case.\n\nAlienMeaningConfidence: I am moderately confident (70) about the interpretation because while the pattern is clear, the exact meaning is speculative.\n\nNow, output in JSON.",
