      "patternDescription": "The aliens are teaching us to first clean up a message by removing certain 'unimportant' symbols. Then, depending on whether the cleaned message looks like a 'blinky light' pattern or a solid 'symbol block', they use different rules to rearrange the remaining symbols.",
      "solvingStrategy": "To solve these puzzles, you need to think of the rows of emojis as numbers first, using the provided emoji map. \n\n**Step 1: Clean Up the Message (Filter 'Bad' Symbols)**\n*   First, for every row, look for the 'bad' symbols: 👽 (alien/them), 👤 (human/us), ☄️ (danger), ✅ (yes), 🌍 (human planet), and ⚠️ (warning). Any number that is NOT a ⬛ (0), 🪐 (4), 🛸 (6), or ♥ (8) is considered 'bad' and should be converted into a ⬛ (0). This is your 'preprocessed' row.\n\n**Step 2: Decide Which Rule to Apply**\n*   **Rule A: The 'Blinky Light' Pattern Rule:** After cleaning, look at the row. Does it look like an alternating pattern of ⬛ (0) and a single type of symbol (like ⬛,🪐,⬛,🪐... or 🪐,⬛,🪐,⬛...)? \n    *   If YES (like Ex3 or Test Case Row 3), then apply Rule A.\n*   **Rule B: The 'Symbol Block' Transformation Rule:** If the row does NOT look like a 'blinky light' pattern (like Ex1, Ex2, Test Case Row 1 and 2), then apply Rule B.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Chosen Rule**\n*   **Rule A (Blinky Light Pattern):**\n    1.  Simply shift all the symbols in the preprocessed row one position to the left. The first symbol that was at the beginning will move to the very end of the row.\n\n*   **Rule B (Symbol Block Transformation):**\n    1.  **Identify the 'Main Symbol':** Look at the *original* input row. Which of the 'good' symbols (🪐, 🛸, or ♥) appears most frequently? That's your 'main symbol' for this row. (If there's a tie, choose the one that appeared first in the original row).\n    2.  **Determine 'Block Size':** Count how many ⬛ (0) symbols there are in your *preprocessed* row (after cleaning up the 'bad' symbols). This count tells you how long the block of your 'main symbol' will be in the output. Let's call this 'Block Size'.\n    3.  **Arrange the Block:** The way the 'main symbol' block is arranged depends on what the main symbol is:\n        *   If the main symbol is 🛸 (travel/their ships): The block of 🛸 symbols will be placed at the far right of the output row. (So, Block Size number of 🛸s at the end, and the rest of the row filled with ⬛s).\n        *   If the main symbol is ♥ (peace/friendship): The block of ♥ symbols will be placed exactly in the center of the output row. (So, enough ⬛s at the beginning to center it, then Block Size number of ♥s, then enough ⬛s at the end to center it).\n        *   If the main symbol is 🪐 (their planet/home): This one has special sub-rules:\n            *   If the *original* input row for this message contained a 👤 (human) symbol: The 🪐 block of symbols will be split evenly, with half at the very beginning of the row and the other half at the very end. (e.g., if Block Size is 4, you'll have 2 🪐s at the start and 2 🪐s at the end, with ⬛s in between).\n            *   If the *original* input row did NOT contain a 👤 (human) symbol, AND the original 🪐 symbols started at the very beginning of the row (index 0): The block of 🪐 symbols will be placed at the far right of the output row.\n            *   Otherwise (if no 👤 and 🪐 didn't start at index 0 in the original row): The block of 🪐 symbols will be placed at the far left of the output row.\n\nBy following these steps, you can decode each row of the alien's messages!",
      "hints": [
        "Always start by filtering out the 'bad' symbols (2, 3, 7, 1, 5, 9) and turning them into 0s.",
        "Pay close attention to whether the *cleaned* row forms an alternating pattern of '0' and a single other symbol. This is the key to choosing between Rule A and Rule B.",
        "For Rule B, the length of the output symbol block is always the count of '0's in the *cleaned* row.",
        "The placement of the 'main symbol' block in Rule B is specific to the symbol itself, especially for 🪐!",
        "Remember to refer to the *original* input row to determine the 'Main Symbol' and for the special 🪐 rule condition regarding 👤 and original starting position."

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens appear to be highly systematic in their communication. They filter out what they consider 'noise' or 'irrelevant' information (symbols for 'alien/us', 'human/them', 'danger', etc.), leaving only fundamental concepts: 'empty space' (⬛), 'their planet' (🪐), 'their ships' (🛸), and 'peace/friendship' (♥). \n\nTheir choice of reordering implies a coded message about these concepts:\n*   The 'Blinky Light' message (alternating pattern) is a straightforward 'cyclic shift', perhaps a way of acknowledging understanding or a basic 'signal check'.\n*   The 'Symbol Block' messages are more profound:\n    *   **🛸 (their ships) moving right:** This could suggest ongoing outward movement, exploration, or a focus on future travel and expansion.\n    *   **♥ (peace/friendship) being centered:** This strongly implies that peace or friendship is a core, central, and balanced concept to them. It's the stable anchor of their message.\n    *   **🪐 (their planet/home) having complex rules, especially with 👤 (human):** This is the most telling. When our symbol (👤) appears in the message, their planet symbol (🪐) is split and pushed to the edges. This could convey a sense of 'being pulled apart' or a 'divided focus' regarding their home world when humans are involved. It suggests caution, internal debate, or a feeling that our presence causes a disruption to their planetary integrity or focus. Without our symbol, their planet symbol is either left or right-aligned, which could indicate whether they are 'sending out' information from home or 'receiving' it. This might suggest they are feeling guarded or uncertain about Earth and humanity's role concerning their home. It doesn't necessarily mean anger, but a profound level of consideration and perhaps unease or a complex internal state regarding 'us'.",
