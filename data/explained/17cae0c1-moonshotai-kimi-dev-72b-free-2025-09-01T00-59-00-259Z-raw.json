  "solvingStrategy": "The key observation is that each input grid is transformed into an output grid where each row is identical and contains a sequence of three repeating numbers. The numbers in the output seem to correspond to the positions of the 5s in the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the left side has three 5s, then a gap, followed by three 5s. The output is three 3s, three 4s, and three 9s. The numbers 3,4,9 might represent the positions of the 5 clusters. Similarly, in Example 2, the 5s are in the top-right and bottom-left corners, leading to 9s, 1s, and 4s. The pattern seems to be that each contiguous group of 5s is assigned a unique number based on their position, and then the output rows are filled with these numbers in the order of their appearance from left to right. For the test case, the input has a vertical line of 5s on the right, a single 5 in the middle, and a block of 5s on the left. The output would assign numbers to these groups (left to right: block, middle, line) and repeat them in each row. The numbers might be 2,7,8 based on the existing examples' numbering, but since the exact mapping isn't clear, I'll use the next available numbers. However, looking at the existing outputs, the numbers used are 1,3,4,6,9. So perhaps the new groups would use 2,7,8. But the actual numbers might be determined by the position in the grid. Alternatively, the numbers are determined by the average position of the 5s in each group. For example, the first group's average x-coordinate (columns) would determine the number. But without a clear mapping, I'll proceed with the pattern that each group is assigned a unique number in the order they appear from left to right, and each row in the output is filled with these numbers repeated three times. Thus, the test case's output would be three 2s, three 7s, and three 8s in each row.",
