      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the input grid and identify where the non-empty symbols start (around row 5-6). 2. Take the bottom 5 rows that contain symbols and flip them vertically like looking in a mirror. 3. Place this flipped version in the top 5 rows. 4. Keep the original bottom 5 rows exactly as they were. Think of it like folding a piece of paper in half - the bottom pattern gets reflected onto the top.",

Given the symbols involved - ‚òÑÔ∏è (danger), ‚úÖ (agreement), üë§ (humans), and ü™ê (their planet) - they might be showing us that problems or situations have mirror consequences, or that actions reflect back on us. The presence of danger symbols suggests they may be warning us that our actions toward them will be reflected back to us. This doesn't seem overtly hostile, but rather a lesson about reciprocity and cause-and-effect.",

      "patternDescription": "Whatever is written in the lower half of the picture is simply copied upside-down into the upper half so that the whole picture becomes perfectly top-bottom symmetrical.  The lower half itself is kept unchanged.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the grid as plain numbers (or emojis).  \n2. Notice that the first 5 rows are completely ‚¨õ (black / 0) in every training input ‚Äì all the interesting symbols live in the last 5 rows.  \n3. Take those last 5 rows (rows 5-9 in a 10-row grid) and reverse their order: the very last row becomes the new first row, the second-to-last becomes the new second row, etc.  \n4. Place this reversed copy into the top half (rows 0-4).  \n5. Leave the original bottom half exactly where it was.  \n6. The result is a picture that reads the same from the top as from the bottom.",

        "Everything important is happening only in the bottom half of the picture.",
        "The output is symmetrical if you flip it upside-down.",

      "alienMeaning": "By making their message look the same right-side-up and upside-down, the aliens might be saying: ‚ÄúWe and you are reflections of each other ‚Äì look at your ‚Äòmirror image‚Äô.‚Äù  The use of ‚òÑÔ∏è (danger) and ‚úÖ (agreement) mixed together could hint that cooperation prevents danger.  The tone feels more thoughtful than hostile.",
