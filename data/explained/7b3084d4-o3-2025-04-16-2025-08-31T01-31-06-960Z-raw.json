  "solvingStrategy": "I analysed the three training pairs and noticed each output is a fully-filled square which always contains exactly the five non-zero colours of the corresponding input.  The top-left cell is the unique colour that occurs only once in the input (colour 5 in every training case).  From that anchor, the same geometrical colour template appears in all three examples – an L-shaped region of colour 7 that runs along the first row (to some length) and down the first column, dividing the square into four remaining territories.  Each of those territories is monochrome, their colours taken from the other three large clusters in the input, and they respect the compass orientation of those clusters (NW → 7, NE → colour of the most northerly–easterly cluster, SW → colour of the most southerly-westerly cluster, SE → colour farthest to the south-east).\n\nFor the test grid I first located the five colours and their roles:\n• 5 – single pixel ⇒ goes to (0,0).\n• 7 – the big NW/SW cluster ⇒ fills the L-shape.\n• 3 – cluster situated furthest to the north-east ⇒ fills the top-right region.\n• 2 – cluster situated furthest to the south-west ⇒ fills the bottom-left region.\n• 8 – south-east cluster ⇒ fills the bottom-right region.\n\nThe template scale that best reconciles the three training sizes with the test clusters is a 6×6 square (same as example 1).  Copying the colour layout of example 1 and replacing its quadrant colours (9→3, 4→2, 3→8) yields the predicted 6×6 output shown.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Identify five non-zero colours; detect that 5 appears exactly once in every input and always becomes the (0,0) anchor",
    "Notice identical colour-layout template (L of 7s plus three monochrome quadrants) in all training outputs",
    "Map remaining three quadrant colours according to relative compass positions of their clusters in the input",
    "Reuse example-1’s 6×6 template size (works for current cluster proportions) and substitute the mapped colours accordingly",
    "Generate final 6×6 grid, fully filled, obeying the discovered template"
  ],
  "patternDescription": "Outputs are fully-filled squares based on a fixed template:\n• (0,0) is the unique-pixel colour 5.\n• An L-shape of 7s extends rightwards along the first row and downward along the first column.\n• The remaining three regions (NE, SW, SE) are filled by the other three colours, chosen according to their compass orientation in the input grid.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm-style:  1) find colour with exactly one cell → anchor.  2) locate largest 7-cluster → build L-shape.  3) Compute centroids of remaining clusters and assign NE, SW, SE.  4) Paint template square.",
    "Math-style:  let C be the set of 5 colours.  Define f: C→{anchor, L, NE, SW, SE}.  f(c)=anchor if |c|=1, f(c)=L if c=7, remaining mapped by argmax/min of (row,col).  Fill 6×6 grid: rows<2∧cols<2 use L else use region colour.",
