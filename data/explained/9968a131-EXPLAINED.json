      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to find the transformation pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\nInput: [[7,3,8,7],[7,8,3,7],[7,3,8,7],[7,8,3,7]]\nOutput: [[7,3,8,7],[7,7,8,3],[7,3,8,7],[7,7,8,3]]\n\nLooking at the input and output, I see that the first row is the same: [7,3,8,7]. The second row changes from [7,8,3,7] to [7,7,8,3]. Similarly, the third row is the same as first: [7,3,8,7], and fourth row changes from [7,8,3,7] to [7,7,8,3].\n\nSo, for even-indexed rows (assuming 0-based indexing), the row is modified. Row 0 and 2 are unchanged, row 1 and 3 are changed.\n\nIn row 1: input [7,8,3,7] → output [7,7,8,3]. It looks like the second and third elements are swapped, but not exactly. Let's see the positions: index 0 is 7, same; index 1 is 8 in input, 7 in output; index 2 is 3 in input, 8 in output; index 3 is 7, same. So, it's not a simple swap. Perhaps it's shifting or something.\n\nMaybe it's related to the values. Notice that in the input, there are numbers 7,3,8. 7 seems common, and 3 and 8 might be special.\n\nIn output, for the changed rows, the pattern is that the non-7 elements are being moved or something.\n\nList the differences:\n\nFor row 1 input: [7,8,3,7] → output [7,7,8,3]\n\nSo, the 8 and 3 have changed positions, and a 7 is inserted or something? No, the length is the same.\n\nPerhaps it's a rotation or shift of the non-7 elements.\n\nIn row 1, the non-7 elements are at positions 1 and 2: 8 and 3. In output, they are at positions 2 and 3: 8 and 3, but order is different? Input has 8 then 3, output has 8 then 3 at different indices? No: input index 1:8, index2:3; output index2:8, index3:3. So the pair (8,3) is shifted right by one position, but the 7 at index 0 and 3 might be fixed.\n\nIn input row 1: indices 0,1,2,3: 7,8,3,7\n\nOutput: 7,7,8,3\n\nSo, the element at index 1 (8) moves to index 2, element at index 2 (3) moves to index 3, and index 1 becomes 7, which was already there at index 0 and 3.\n\nBut index 1 was 8, now 7, and index 3 was 7, now 3. So it's like the non-7 elements are shifted, and the 7s are static.\n\nDefine the background color or value. 7 seems to be the background, and 3 and 8 are objects.\n\nIn the unchanged rows, like row 0: [7,3,8,7] which has 3 and 8, and it's unchanged. Row 2 same.\n\nOnly the rows that have a different pattern are changed? Row 0 and 2 are [7,3,8,7], row 1 and 3 are [7,8,3,7] in input.\n\nIn output, row 0 and 2 unchanged, row 1 and 3 changed to [7,7,8,3].\n\nSo, perhaps for rows where the non-7 elements are in a certain order, they are transformed.\n\nNow look at Example 2:\n\nInput: [[0,5,7,7,7,7],[5,0,7,7,7,7],[0,5,7,7,7,7],[5,0,7,7,7,7],[0,5,7,7,7,7],[5,0,7,7,7,7]]\n\nOutput: [[0,5,7,7,7,7],[7,5,0,7,7,7],[0,5,7,7,7,7],[7,5,0,7,7,7],[0,5,7,7,7,7],[7,5,0,7,7,7]]\n\nHere, the first row is [0,5,7,7,7,7] and it's unchanged in output.\n\nSecond row input [5,0,7,7,7,7] → output [7,5,0,7,7,7]\n\nThird row [0,5,7,7,7,7] unchanged.\n\nFourth row [5,0,7,7,7,7] → [7,5,0,7,7,7]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, similar pattern: rows with [0,5,7,...] are unchanged, rows with [5,0,7,...] are changed to [7,5,0,7,7,7]\n\nIn the changed rows, the non-7 elements are 5 and 0, and they seem to be shifted or something.\n\nIn input second row: [5,0,7,7,7,7] → output [7,5,0,7,7,7]\n\nSo, index 0 was 5, now 7; index 1 was 0, now 5; index 2 was 7, now 0; and indices 3-5 are 7, unchanged.\n\nSo, the elements at index 0 and 1 (5 and 0) have moved: 5 to index 1, 0 to index 2, and index 0 becomes 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, for row 1: input [7,8,3,7] → output [7,7,8,3]\n\nIndices: 0:7→7, 1:8→7, 2:3→8, 3:7→3\n\nSo, element at index 1 (8) moves to index 2, element at index 2 (3) moves to index 3, and index 1 is filled with 7.\n\nIn both cases, it seems that for rows where the first two elements are not both 7 or something, but in Example 1, row 1 has first element 7, second 8, which is not 7.\n\nPerhaps it's about the position of non-background elements.\n\nDefine the background value. In both examples, 7 seems to be the background color that is common and fills most cells.\n\nIn Example 1, background is 7, and objects are 3 and 8.\n\nIn Example 2, background is 7, and objects are 0 and 5.\n\nNow, in the input, for rows that are changed, the objects are adjacent or something.\n\nIn Example 1, unchanged rows: [7,3,8,7] — so objects at index 1 and 2: 3 and 8.\n\nChanged rows: [7,8,3,7] — objects at index 1 and 2: 8 and 3, which is the reverse order.\n\nIn output, changed rows become [7,7,8,3] — so objects are shifted right, with the left object moving to the right or something.\n\nFrom input [7,8,3,7] to output [7,7,8,3], it seems that the pair of objects is shifted one position to the right, and the left position is filled with background.\n\nSimilarly in Example 2: input [5,0,7,7,7,7] to output [7,5,0,7,7,7] — objects 5 and 0 are shifted right: 5 moves from index 0 to index 1, 0 moves from index 1 to index 2, and index 0 becomes background 7.\n\nIn the unchanged rows, like [0,5,7,7,7,7], the objects are at index 0 and 1: 0 and 5, and they are not shifted; the row remains the same.\n\nIn Example 1, unchanged rows have objects at index 1 and 2, not shifted.\n\nBut in both cases, the objects are in the first positions or something.\n\nLet's find a pattern.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is applied to rows where the first element is not background, or something.\n\nIn Example 1, unchanged rows: row 0 [7,3,8,7] — first element is 7 (background)\n\nRow 2 same.\n\nChanged rows: row 1 [7,8,3,7] — first element is 7 (background), same as unchanged. Not that.\n\nLook at the sequence of non-background elements.\n\nIn Example 1, for a row, if the non-background elements are at the beginning or end.\n\nList the positions.\n\nIn Example 1 input:\n\nRow 0: indices with non-7: 1:3, 2:8\n\nRow 1: indices with non-7: 1:8, 2:3\n\nRow 2: same as row 0\n\nRow 3: same as row 1\n\nOutput: row 0 unchanged, row 1: non-7 at 2:8, 3:3\n\nRow 2 unchanged, row 3: non-7 at 2:8, 3:3\n\nSo, for rows where the non-7 elements are at indices 1 and 2, but in a certain order? Row 0 has 3 then 8, row 1 has 8 then 3.\n\nIn output, when the order is 8 then 3 in input, it becomes shifted to indices 2 and 3 with 8 then 3.\n\nSimilarly in Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: [0,5,7,7,7,7] — non-7 at 0:0, 1:5\n\nRow 1: [5,0,7,7,7,7] — non-7 at 0:5, 1:0\n\nRow 2: same as row 0\n\nRow 3: same as row 1\n\nEtc.\n\nOutput: row 0 unchanged — non-7 at 0:0, 1:5\n\nRow 1: [7,5,0,7,7,7] — non-7 at 1:5, 2:0\n\nRow 2 unchanged\n\nRow 3: non-7 at 1:5, 2:0\n\nSo, for rows where the non-background elements are at the very left (indices 0 and 1), if they are in the order that matches the unchanged pattern? In row 0, it's 0 then 5, and unchanged. In row 1, it's 5 then 0, and changed.\n\nIn both examples, the unchanged rows have the non-background elements in a specific order: in Ex1, 3 then 8; in Ex2, 0 then 5.\n\nAnd the changed rows have the reverse order: in Ex1, 8 then 3; in Ex2, 5 then 0.\n\nAnd when changed, the non-background elements are shifted one position to the right, and the leftmost position is filled with background.\n\nIn Ex1, for changed row, input [7,8,3,7] — non-bg at 1 and 2: 8 and 3, output non-bg at 2 and 3: 8 and 3, so shifted right.\n\nSimilarly in Ex2, input [5,0,7,7,7,7] — non-bg at 0 and 1: 5 and 0, output non-bg at 1 and 2: 5 and 0, shifted right.\n\nIn the unchanged rows, the non-bg elements are already at the left or something, but in Ex1, unchanged row has non-bg at 1 and 2, not shifted, while changed has non-bg at 1 and 2 but shifted? No, in Ex1 unchanged, non-bg at 1 and 2, not shifted; changed, non-bg at 1 and 2 in input, but after shift, at 2 and 3.\n\nBut the key might be the order of the non-bg elements.\n\nIn both examples, the unchanged rows have the non-bg elements in ascending order or something? In Ex1, 3 and 8, 3<8; in Ex2, 0 and 5, 0<5. Changed rows have descending order: Ex1 8>3, Ex2 5>0.\n\nAnd when the order is descending, they are shifted right by one position.\n\nIn the output, after shift, the order remains the same: in Ex1, 8 and 3 still descending; in Ex2, 5 and 0 descending.\n\nBut in the unchanged rows, the order is ascending, and no shift.\n\nNow, for the test case.\n\nTest case input: [[7,7,7,7,7],[7,2,9,7,7],[7,9,2,7,7],[7,2,9,7,7],[7,7,7,7,7]]\n\nFirst, identify the background. Probably 7, since it's common.\n\nNon-background elements are 2 and 9.\n\nNow, look at each row.\n\nRow 0: all 7s, so no non-bg elements. What happens to such rows? In training examples, all rows have non-bg elements, but here some rows might have none.\n\nIn the output, for rows with no non-bg, probably unchanged.\n\nBut let's see the pattern from training.\n\nIn training, all rows have exactly two non-background elements, I think.\n\nIn Ex1, each row has two non-7s.\n\nIn Ex2, each row has two non-7s: either 0 and 5 or 5 and 0.\n\nIn test case, row 0: all 7s, so zero non-bg.\n\nRow 1: [7,2,9,7,7] — non-bg at index 1 and 2: 2 and 9\n\nRow 2: [7,9,2,7,7] — non-bg at index 1 and 2: 9 and 2\n\nRow 3: [7,2,9,7,7] — same as row 1\n\nRow 4: all 7s\n\nNow, based on the pattern from training, we need to check the order of non-bg elements.\n\nIn training, when non-bg are in ascending order, no change; when in descending order, shift right.\n\nIn Ex1, ascending: 3 and 8, 3<8, unchanged.\n\nDescending: 8 and 3, 8>3, shifted.\n\nSimilarly in Ex2, ascending: 0 and 5, 0<5, unchanged.\n\nDescending: 5 and 0, 5>0, shifted.\n\nNow in test case:\n\nRow 1: non-bg 2 and 9, 2<9, so ascending order, should be unchanged.\n\nRow 2: non-bg 9 and 2, 9>2, descending order, should be shifted right.\n\nRow 3: same as row 1, ascending, unchanged.\n\nRow 0 and 4: no non-bg, probably unchanged, as there's nothing to shift.\n\nFor rows with no non-bg, in training, all rows have non-bg, but logically, if no non-bg, no change.\n\nNow, for shifting: in the shift, the non-bg elements move one position to the right, and the leftmost position of where they were is filled with background.\n\nIn the changed rows, the non-bg elements are shifted, and the cell that was left is set to bg.\n\nIn test case row 2: input [7,9,2,7,7] — non-bg at index 1 and 2: 9 and 2.\n\nAfter shift right, they should move to index 2 and 3: so index 2 becomes 9, index 3 becomes 2, and index 1, which was 9, becomes bg (7). Index 0 and 4 are already bg, unchanged.\n\nSo output for row 2 should be: index 0:7, index 1:7 (bg), index 2:9, index 3:2, index 4:7\n\nSimilarly, for rows with non-bg, we need to identify their positions.\n\nIn the training examples, the non-bg elements are always adjacent or in specific positions.\n\nIn Ex1, non-bg are at indices 1 and 2 for all rows.\n\nIn Ex2, non-bg are at indices 0 and 1 for all rows.\n\nIn test case, for rows with non-bg, they are at indices 1 and 2, similar to Ex1.\n\nSo, for a row, if there are non-bg elements, they are at fixed positions? Not necessarily, but in these examples, they are.\n\nIn test case, rows 1,2,3 have non-bg at indices 1 and 2.\n\nRow 0 and 4 have no non-bg.\n\nNow, for row 1: non-bg 2 and 9, order 2<9 ascending, so unchanged: [7,2,9,7,7]\n\nRow 2: non-bg 9 and 2, order 9>2 descending, so shift right: input [7,9,2,7,7] → output [7,7,9,2,7] ? Let's see.\n\nAfter shift: non-bg move to right by one, so from indices 1 and 2 to 2 and 3.\n\nSo index 2 becomes 9 (was 2, but now 9), index 3 becomes 2 (was 7), and index 1 becomes 7 (was 9).\n\nSo [index0:7, index1:7, index2:9, index3:2, index4:7]\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same as row 1, ascending, unchanged: [7,2,9,7,7]\n\nRow 0: all 7s, unchanged: [7,7,7,7,7]\n\nRow 4: all 7s, unchanged: [7,7,7,7,7]\n\nSo the full output should be:\n\nRow 0: [7,7,7,7,7]\n\nRow 1: [7,2,9,7,7] unchanged\n\nRow 2: [7,7,9,2,7] after shift\n\nRow 3: [7,2,9,7,7] unchanged\n\nRow 4: [7,7,7,7,7]\n\nNow, is this consistent with training?\n\nIn training, for Ex1, when shifted, the non-bg move to indices 2 and 3, and index 1 becomes bg.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nAlso, for rows with no non-bg, no change, which makes sense.\n\nNow, to confirm, in the output, for row 2, index 4 was 7, and after shift, it remains 7, since we're only shifting the non-bg elements within their range.\n\nIn the shift, the rightmost cell might change if non-bg moves there.\n\nIn Ex2, when shifted, for row 1 input [5,0,7,7,7,7] → output [7,5,0,7,7,7], so non-bg moved to index 1 and 2, and index 0 became bg, indices 3-5 unchanged.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nSo for test case, predicted output should be:\n\n[[7,7,7,7,7], [7,2,9,7,7], [7,7,9,2,7], [7,2,9,7,7], [7,7,7,7,7]]\n\nNow, for the JSON response, I need to have \"predictedOutput\" as the first field.\n\nThen solvingStrategy, etc.\n\nAlso, confidence: I'm pretty sure, say 95.\n\nPattern description: For each row, if there are exactly two non-background elements (value 7 is background), check their order. If the two non-bg elements are in ascending numerical order, the row remains unchanged. If in descending order, shift the two non-bg elements one position to the right, setting the leftmost of their original positions to background (7). If no non-bg elements, row unchanged.\n\nIn this case, non-bg are at fixed indices in the examples, but in test case, they are at indices 1 and 2, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is more general, but in training, non-bg are always adjacent and at the start or middle.\n\nBut in test case, it matches.\n\nSo, I think this is correct.",
