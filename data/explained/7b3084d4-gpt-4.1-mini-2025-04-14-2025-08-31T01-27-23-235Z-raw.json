  "solvingStrategy": "I analyzed the training examples to identify the transformation pattern. Each training input contains multiple colored regions scattered in a large grid. The output is a cropped, smaller grid that tightly encloses the main clusters of colored regions, preserving their relative arrangement and colors. The output grid extracts the bounding box around the significant colored areas, removing empty rows and columns. The colors and their relative positions inside this bounding box remain unchanged. Applying this to the test input, I located the minimal rectangle containing all colored regions (colors 2,3,7,8,5) and extracted that subgrid as the output. The output grid is smaller and contains the same color clusters in the same relative arrangement as in the input, cropped tightly to the colored area.",

    "Identified the bounding box coordinates covering all non-zero colored pixels in the input.",
