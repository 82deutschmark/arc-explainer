Create a new grid that has 3 (ðŸ‘¤) only in positions where it was in the input grid, and turn all other numbers into nothing (â¬›). 3. The final grid should only show 3s (ðŸ‘¤) in the correct places, with nothing (â¬›) filling the other spots. For clarity, think of the numbers instead of emojis if you're confused, 3s stay and everything else turns to 0s.",
