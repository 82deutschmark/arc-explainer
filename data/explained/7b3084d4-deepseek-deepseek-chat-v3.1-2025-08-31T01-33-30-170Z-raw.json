Each example shows that the output is created by extracting and combining the non-zero regions from the input grid. The pattern involves: 1) Identifying all contiguous regions of non-zero values, 2) Sorting these regions by their minimum row and column coordinates (top-left to bottom-right), 3) Extracting the bounding boxes of these regions, 4) Combining them into a single output grid by placing them adjacent to each other in the sorted order. In the test case, I identified two main regions: a large '2' region in the top-left and a large '3' region in the top-right, plus a '7' region and '8' region in the bottom. The special value '5' appears at the boundary between regions and gets included in the appropriate region.",
