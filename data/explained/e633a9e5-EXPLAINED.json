      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to understand the puzzle based on the training examples and the test case. All inputs are 3x3 grids of numbers, and outputs are 5x5 grids. From the examples:\n\n- Example 1 Input: [[1,3,5],[1,2,8],[8,3,8]] Output: [[1,1,3,5,5],[1,1,3,5,5],[1,1,2,8,8],[8,8,3,8,8],[8,8,3,8,8]]\n\n- Example 2 Input: [[6,5,5],[5,1,7],[4,5,2]] Output: [[6,6,5,5,5],[6,6,5,5,5],[5,5,1,7,7],[4,4,5,2,2],[4,4,5,2,2]]\n\n- Example 3 Input: [[2,3,7],[2,1,6],[1,5,7]] Output: [[2,2,3,7,7],[2,2,3,7,7],[2,2,1,6,6],[1,1,5,7,7],[1,1,5,7,7]]\n\n- Test Input: [[1,2,5],[7,3,6],[7,6,5]] Output: [[1,1,2,5,5],[1,1,2,5,5],[7,7,3,6,6],[7,7,6,5,5],[7,7,6,5,5]]\n\nI need to find the pattern or transformation that turns a 3x3 input into a 5x5 output.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they seem to be expanded versions. Specifically, each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output that has the first element repeated twice, then the original elements, and then the last element repeated twice. But that doesn't match because in the output, the rows aren't direct mappings.\n\nLet me compare input and output for a single row.\n\nTake Example 1:\n\nInput row 1: [1,3,5] → Output row 1: [1,1,3,5,5] → so it's like the first element repeated, then the original elements, then last repeated? But it's [1,1,3,5,5], which is first element twice, then second element, then third element twice? No: positions: input indices: 0:1, 1:3, 2:5. Output: 0:1, 1:1, 2:3, 3:5, 4:5. So it's element0 repeated, element1, element2 repeated. But element1 is not repeated; it's only once.\n\nIn output row: [1,1,3,5,5] → so for a row, it seems: repeat first element twice, then the middle element once, then repeat the last element twice? But in input, it's three elements, so middle is element1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, input row 2: [1,2,8] → output row 3: [1,1,2,8,8] → same pattern.\n\nInput row 3: [8,3,8] → output row 4: [8,8,3,8,8] and row 5: same.\n\nBut the output has 5 rows, and input has 3 rows. So how are rows handled?\n\nIn Example 1 output: row1 and row2 are identical: both [1,1,3,5,5], corresponding to input row1.\n\nRow3 is [1,1,2,8,8], from input row2.\n\nRow4 and row5 are both [8,8,3,8,8], from input row3.\n\nSo it seems: the first input row is duplicated to two identical rows in output, with each transformed as: repeat first element twice, then middle element once, then last element twice.\n\nSimilarly for second input row: duplicated once? In this case, input row2 is only in one output row? No: output row3 is from input row2, but only one row? Output has row3 as [1,1,2,8,8], and that's it for row2 input. But earlier I said duplicated, but in output, row1 and row2 are both from input row1.\n\nList:\n\n- Output row1: based on input row1\n\n- Output row2: also based on input row1? Same as row1.\n\n- Output row3: based on input row2\n\n- Output row4: based on input row3\n\n- Output row5: based on input row3? Same as row4.\n\nIn Example 1: input has 3 rows, output has 5 rows: rows 1 and 2 identical, from input row1; row3 from input row2; rows 4 and 5 identical, from input row3.\n\nSimilarly in Example 2:\n\nInput: row1 [6,5,5], row2 [5,1,7], row3 [4,5,2]\n\nOutput: row1 and row2 both [6,6,5,5,5] — that's from input row1: repeat first twice (6,6), then middle once? Input row1 is [6,5,5], middle is 5, but in output it's [6,6,5,5,5] — so first element repeated twice (6,6), then the original elements? [5,5], but original has two 5s, but in output it's 5,5,5 — positions: after first repeat, it's 5 (which is element1), then 5 (element2), but element2 is 5, and it's repeated? In [6,6,5,5,5], it's like repeat first element twice, then list the original elements, but original has three elements: element0=6, element1=5, element2=5. Output has element0 repeated twice (6,6), then element1 once (5), then element2 repeated twice? But element2 is 5, and it's repeated to 5,5? In output it's three 5s at the end? No: [6,6,5,5,5] — indices 2,3,4 are 5,5,5 — but input element1 and element2 are both 5, so it's a bit messy.\n\nPerhaps it's: for each row, the output row is: first element repeated twice, then the entire original row? But original row has three elements, so that would be 2 + 3 = 5 elements, but in output it's [first rep, first rep, elem1, elem2, elem2 rep? Inconsistent.\n\nLet's look at the values.\n\nIn Example 1 input row1: [1,3,5] → output [1,1,3,5,5] — so positions: output col0: rep of input col0, col1: rep of input col0? No, col0 and col1 both input col0 value, col2 is input col1 value, col3 is input col2 value? But col4 is input col2 value again? In [1,1,3,5,5], col0=1 (input col0), col1=1 (input col0), col2=3 (input col1), col3=5 (input col2), col4=5 (input col2). So yes: repeat first column twice, then middle column once, then last column twice? But middle column is only once, last is twice.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut for the row duplication: in output, the first input row is duplicated to two rows, the second input row to one row? In Example 1, input row2: [1,2,8] → output row3: [1,1,2,8,8] — only one row, while input row1 has two identical output rows.\n\nIn Example 2, input row1: [6,5,5] → output row1 and row2 both [6,6,5,5,5] — now, [6,6,5,5,5], for input [6,5,5], so col0 and col1 both 6 (input col0), col2=5 (input col1? But input col1 is 5, input col2 is also 5, but in output col2=5, col3=5, col4=5 — that's three 5s, whereas input has two 5s.\n\nPerhaps it's not based on columns directly.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output grid is created by repeating the first row and last row of input, and transforming each.\n\nNotice that in all examples, the output has the first row of input transformed and duplicated, the middle row transformed once, and the last row transformed and duplicated.\n\nIn Example 1: input rows: row0, row1, row2.\n\nOutput: two rows from row0, one from row1, two from row2.\n\nIn Example 2: same: output row1 and row2 from input row0, row3 from input row1, row4 and row5 from input row2.\n\nIn Example 3: input row0 [2,3,7], output row1 and row2 both [2,2,3,7,7] — from row0.\n\nInput row1 [2,1,6], output row3 [2,2,1,6,6] — from row1.\n\nInput row2 [1,5,7], output row4 and row5 both [1,1,5,7,7] — from row2.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow for each transformed row: for a input row [a,b,c], the output row is [a,a,b,c,c].\n\nIn Example 1 row0 input [1,3,5] → output [1,1,3,5,5] — yes, a=1,b=3,c=5 → [a,a,b,c,c].\n\nRow1 input [1,2,8] → [1,1,2,8,8] — a=1,b=2,c=8 → [a,a,b,c,c].\n\nRow2 input [8,3,8] → [8,8,3,8,8] — a=8,b=3,c=8 → [a,a,b,c,c].\n\nIn Example 2, row0 input [6,5,5] → output [6,6,5,5,5] — a=6,b=5,c=5 → [a,a,b,c,c] = [6,6,5,5,5] — but b and c are both 5, so it ends with three 5s, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAnd for the row duplication: first input row duplicated twice in output, middle input row once, last input row duplicated twice.\n\nIn all cases, since input has three rows, output has five: two for first, one for middle, two for last.\n\nNow for the test case: input [[1,2,5],[7,3,6],[7,6,5]]\n\nApply the same:\n\n- For input row0: [1,2,5] → transformed to [a,a,b,c,c] = [1,1,2,5,5]\n\n- Duplicated twice: so output row1 and row2 both [1,1,2,5,5]\n\n- For input row1: [7,3,6] → transformed to [7,7,3,6,6]\n\n- Once: so output row3: [7,7,3,6,6]\n\n- For input row2: [7,6,5] → transformed to [7,7,6,5,5]\n\n- Duplicated twice: so output row4 and row5 both [7,7,6,5,5]\n\nWhich matches the correct answer: [[1,1,2,5,5],[1,1,2,5,5],[7,7,3,6,6],[7,7,6,5,5],[7,7,6,5,5]]\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row in the input grid, create a new row by repeating the first element twice, then the middle element once, then the last element twice. Then, for the output grid, duplicate the transformed row for the first input row twice, use the transformed row for the middle input row once, and duplicate the transformed row for the last input row twice.\n\nNow, in terms of ARC-AGI transformation types:\n\n- This involves pattern repetition and extension.\n\n- Specifically, it's a grid operation: expanding the grid by duplicating rows and modifying columns.\n\n- It could be seen as a combination of row duplication and column-wise pattern extension.\n\nFor the explanation, I need to explain in simple terms, and the user sees emojis, not numbers. So I should use the emoji mapping.\n\nEmoji map:\n\n0: ⬛\n\n1: ✅\n\n2: 👽\n\n3: 👤\n\n4: 🪐\n\n5: 🌍\n\n6: 🛸\n\n7: ☄️\n\n8: ♥\n\n9: ⚠️\n\nFor the test input: [[1,2,5],[7,3,6],[7,6,5]] → emojis: row0: [✅, 👽, 🌍], row1: [☄️, 👤, 🛸], row2: [☄️, 🛸, 🌍]\n\nOutput: [[✅,✅,👽,🌍,🌍], [✅,✅,👽,🌍,🌍], [☄️,☄️,👤,🛸,🛸], [☄️,☄️,🛸,🌍,🌍], [☄️,☄️,🛸,🌍,🌍]]\n\nSo in simple terms: the aliens are repeating certain parts to emphasize them.\n\nNow, for the JSON response:\n\n1. patternDescription: Simple explanation of the transformation. E.g., \"The aliens are expanding the grid by repeating the first and last elements of each row and duplicating the top and bottom rows.\"\n\n2. solvingStrategy: Step-by-step for novices. Since they see emojis, I should say: Look at the input grid. For each row, create a new row by repeating the first emoji twice, then the middle emoji once, then the last emoji twice. Then, for the output grid, use two copies of the transformed first row, one copy of the transformed middle row, and two copies of the transformed last row.\n\n3. hints: Key insights like \"Notice that the first and last elements are repeated in each row,\" \"The top and bottom rows are duplicated,\" \"The middle row is used only once.\"\n\n4. alienMeaning: Speculate what the aliens might be communicating. Based on the logic, it's about repetition and emphasis. With symbols: they have ✅ (yes), 👽 (them), 🌍 (Earth), ☄️ (danger), 👤 (us), 🛸 (ships). So in the output, they're emphasizing danger and Earth. Perhaps they're warning about something involving Earth and their ships. But I need to be creative. Maybe they're showing a pattern where danger is repeated, so hostile intentions? Or perhaps it's neutral. Confidence low.\n\n5. confidence: For the solving part, I'm very sure, say 100. For alien meaning, low, say 30.\n\n6. alienMeaningConfidence: Separate score for the message interpretation.\n\nNow, structure the JSON.\n\npatternDescription: \"The transformation involves expanding each row by repeating the first and last elements, and duplicating the top and bottom rows of the grid.\"\n\nsolvingStrategy: \"1. Take the input grid. For each row: make a new row with the first emoji repeated twice, the middle emoji once, and the last emoji twice. 2. For the output grid: use two identical copies of the transformed first row, one copy of the transformed middle row, and two identical copies of the transformed last row.\"\n\nhints: [\"Each row in the output has the first and last elements repeated.\", \"The top and bottom rows of the input are duplicated in the output.\", \"The middle row is used only once.\"]\n\nalienMeaning: \"Based on the repetition, the aliens might be emphasizing certain elements. In this case, they repeat danger (☄️) and Earth (🌍), possibly indicating a warning about threats to Earth. They could be communicating a pattern of danger involving us and our planet.\"\n\nconfidence: 100 (since the logic is clear)\n\nalienMeaningConfidence: 40 (speculative)\n\nNow, for the ARC-AGI types, I should mention in patternDescription. But the question asks to speculate about why it's correct using those types, but in the JSON, it's part of the explanation.\n\nThe JSON has \"patternDescription\" which should cover it.\n\nAlso, in solvingStrategy, if they need to think in numbers, but since they see emojis, I should say to use emojis, as per \"explain it in simple terms an idiot could understand. The user sees the puzzle as emojis, NOT AS NUMBERS.\" So I'll use emojis in the strategy.\n\nFinally, respond with JSON only.",
