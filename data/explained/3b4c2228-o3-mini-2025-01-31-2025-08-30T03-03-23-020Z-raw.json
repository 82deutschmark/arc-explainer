  "solvingStrategy": "We observed that in all training examples the output is a fixed 3√ó3 grid with a diagonal pattern of ones. The number of ones (placed in the top‚Äêleft, center, and bottom‚Äêright positions) varies between examples ‚Äì sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes three. After exploring several possibilities (including geometric partitioning, row/column sums, or global counts), the most consistent explanation was to count certain connected regions in the input. In particular, if we extract only the cells with value 3 and use 8‚Äëdirection connectivity, then (by considering only regions of size 3 or more, with a default of 1 if none qualify) the training examples yield counts that exactly match the number of ones on the output diagonal. For instance, in training examples the groups of 3‚Äôs (with size at least 3) were 2 in some cases (yielding an output with ones at (0,0) and (1,1)), 1 in others, or 3 (yielding a full diagonal of ones). Thus the transformation rule is: ‚ÄúFind all contiguous regions (using 8‚Äëneighbor connectivity) of cells with value 3. Count only those regions whose size is at least 3; if no such region exists, use 1 as the count. Then form a 3√ó3 grid where the first ‚Äòcount‚Äô diagonal cells (starting from the top‚Äëleft) are set to 1 and all other cells are 0.‚Äù  Applying this rule to the two test cases produced the predicted outputs below.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Note that every output is a 3x3 grid with a diagonal of ones.",
    "Explored if the count of ones might come from geometric partitions or overall sums.",
    "Identified that isolating the digit 3 and then grouping using 8‚Äëneighbor connectivity produces groups of various sizes.",
    "Decided to count only groups with at least 3 cells (defaulting to 1 if none qualify).",
    "Matched the counts in training examples (example1 and example4 give 2, example2 and example5 give 1, and example3 gives 3).",
    "Applied the same procedure to the test case inputs to decide the number of ones and thus the diagonal pattern."

  "patternDescription": "Extract all cells with value 3 and group them into contiguous regions using 8‚Äëneighbor connectivity. Consider only groups with a size of at least 3; if there are none, take the count as 1. Then output a 3x3 grid with that number of ones placed along the main diagonal (starting at position (0,0)), and zeros elsewhere.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm (pseudo-code): count = 0; for each cell with value 3 not visited, perform flood-fill (8-neighbors) to count group size; if group_size >=3, increment count; if count==0 then count=1; create a 3x3 grid with ones at positions (i,i) for i in 0..(count-1) and zeros elsewhere.",
