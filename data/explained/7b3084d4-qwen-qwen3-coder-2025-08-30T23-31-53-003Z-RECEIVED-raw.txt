  "solvingStrategy": "First, I analyzed the training examples to identify the pattern. In each case, it seems like the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid, focusing on the area that contains the most varied and dense non-zero elements. I looked for the bounding box of all non-zero elements in the input and used that to define the output. For the test case, I identified the bounding box of all non-zero elements which spans from row 0 to row 19 and column 0 to column 19. However, this didn't match the examples. I then realized that the output grids in the examples are much smaller. I re-examined the examples and noticed that the output grids seem to be a condensed representation of the input grids, focusing on the main shapes or clusters of non-zero elements. I tried to identify the main clusters of non-zero elements in the test case and create a bounding box around them. I identified three main clusters: a 2s cluster in the top-left, a 3s cluster in the top-right, a 7s cluster in the middle-left, and an 8s cluster in the bottom-right. I created a bounding box that encompasses all these clusters and used that to define the output. This approach seems to align better with the examples.",
