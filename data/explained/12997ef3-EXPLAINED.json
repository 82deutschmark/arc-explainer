      "reasoningLog": "We are given a problem: \"When viewed as matrices, which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark?\" However, the test case and examples are about transforming an input matrix into an output matrix.\n\nLooking at the training examples and the test case, we can observe:\n\n- The input is a matrix (list of lists) with mostly zeros and some non-zero numbers.\n- The output is a matrix (list of lists) that seems to be constructed by grouping the non-zero numbers and creating 3x3 (or sometimes other sized) blocks for each distinct non-zero number.\n\nLet's analyze the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \n[\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  ... (all zeros)\n]\nOutput: \n[\n  [0,6,0],\n  [6,6,0],\n  [0,0,6],\n  [0,2,0],\n  [2,2,0],\n  [0,0,2]\n]\n\nHere, the non-zero numbers are 1, 6, and 2. But note that the output has blocks for 6 and 2, but not for 1? Actually, looking at the input, the 1's form a pattern? However, the output only has 6 and 2. Let me check again: the input has 6, 1, and 2. But the output has two blocks: one for 6 and one for 2. Why not for 1?\n\nWait, in the input row 3: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> one 1.\nRow 4: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] -> two 1's and one 2.\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0] -> one 6.\nRow 4: also has a 2.\n\nBut the output does not have a block for 1. Instead, the output has:\n  [0,6,0] -> row0\n  [6,6,0] -> row1\n  [0,0,6] -> row2\n  [0,2,0] -> row3\n  [2,2,0] -> row4\n  [0,0,2] -> row5\n\nIt seems that for each distinct non-zero number (ignoring the pattern of 1's? but 1 is non-zero) that appears, we create a 3x3 block? But 6 and 2 are the only ones that get blocks? And the 1's are not represented? \n\nAlternatively, note that the input matrix has non-zero numbers at specific positions. The output might be grouping by the non-zero numbers and then creating a 3x3 matrix for each. However, in the output, we have two groups: one for 6 and one for 2, and each group is represented by three rows? Actually, each group is represented by three rows? For 6: three rows, for 2: three rows? So total 6 rows.\n\nBut why 1 is ignored? Because the 1's are adjacent? Let me see the positions of 1: \nRow 2: column 3 -> (2,3)\nRow 3: column 2 and 3 -> (3,2) and (3,3)\nRow 4: column 4 -> (4,4)\n\nBut note that row 4 has a 1 at (4,4) and row 3 has two 1's at (3,2) and (3,3). Also row 2 has a 1 at (2,3). They are not connected? \n\nWait, the problem might be that we are only considering non-zero numbers that are isolated? Or perhaps the pattern is to take each non-zero number that appears in the input and then create a 3x3 block that has that number in the center? But in the output for 6, we have:\n  [0,6,0] -> center is 6? Actually, the center of a 3x3 would be the middle element. In [0,6,0] the center (if we consider 3x1) is 6. But the output is a list of rows? Actually, the output is a matrix of 6 rows and 3 columns? For 6, we have three rows: [0,6,0], [6,6,0], [0,0,6]. This doesn't look like a 3x3 block? It's three separate rows? Actually, it's a 3x3 matrix? But it's represented as three rows of three elements? No: each inner list has three elements? Yes: [0,6,0] is one row, then [6,6,0] is another, then [0,0,6]. So that's a 3x3 matrix? Actually, it's 3 rows and 3 columns? Yes.\n\nBut why for 6 we have:\nRow0: [0,6,0]\nRow1: [6,6,0]\nRow2: [0,0,6]\n\nAnd for 2:\nRow3: [0,2,0]\nRow4: [2,2,0]\nRow5: [0,0,2]\n\nSo the pattern for each distinct non-zero number (say n) is to create a 3x3 matrix that has:\nRow0: [0, n, 0]\nRow1: [n, n, 0]\nRow2: [0, 0, n]\n\nBut in the output, we have two such matrices stacked vertically? So the output is the concatenation of these 3x3 matrices? \n\nBut what about the 1? Why is it not included? Let's see the input: the non-zero numbers are 1, 6, 2. But note that the 1 appears in multiple places? Maybe we are only considering non-zero numbers that appear as isolated? Or perhaps the problem is that we are to extract each connected component? But the 1's are not connected? \n\nAlternatively, look at the non-zero numbers: 1, 6, 2. But the output only includes 6 and 2. Why? Because the 1's are not the only non-zero in their row? Or because we are ignoring non-zero numbers that are less than 2? That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in row2, col3; row3, col2 and col3; row4, col4. But note that the output does not have a block for 1. So maybe the rule is: for each non-zero number that appears in the input, but only if it is the only non-zero in its row? \n\nRow2: has 6 and 1? But row2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> only one non-zero? Actually, row2 has only one non-zero? Row2: index 1? Actually, the rows are given as a list of rows. Row0: all zeros. Row1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0] -> non-zero at column 7? (index 7). Row2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> non-zero at column 3. Row3: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] -> non-zero at column2 (1), column3 (1), column7 (2). So row3 has three non-zero. Row4: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> non-zero at column4.\n\nSo for row3, we have two 1's and one 2. But the 1's are adjacent? They are in the same row? \n\nBut the output does not include 1. So perhaps the rule is: for each non-zero number that appears in the input, but only if it is the only non-zero in the entire row and column? That doesn't hold for 6: in row1, 6 is the only non-zero? Yes. In row2, 1 is the only non-zero? Yes. In row3, there are three non-zeros? So maybe we skip rows that have more than one non-zero? But then we have row4: only one non-zero (1). So we should have a block for 1? But we don't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we are only considering non-zero numbers that are greater than 1? But 1 is non-zero and not included? But in the test case, we have 2,3,6,7, etc.\n\nLet's look at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n[\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0],\n  [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [1,1,1,0,0,8,0,0,0],\n  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  ... (zeros)\n]\nOutput:\n[\n  [0,3,3],\n  [3,3,3],\n  [0,3,0],\n  [0,6,6],\n  [6,6,6],\n  [0,6,0],\n  [0,8,8],\n  [8,8,8],\n  [0,8,0]\n]\n\nHere, the non-zero numbers are 3,6,8, and also 1. But the output has blocks for 3,6,8, but not for 1. Why? The 1's appear in rows 4,5,6. Row4: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> two non-zeros. Row5: [1,1,1,0,0,8,0,0,0] -> four non-zeros (three 1's and one 8). Row6: [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> one non-zero. So row6 has only one non-zero? But we don't have a block for 1? So the rule might be: we only consider non-zero numbers that are at least 2? Because 1 is skipped? But in Example 1, 1 was skipped and in Example 2, 1 is skipped. In Example 3, the input has 3 and 2 (non-zero) and output has blocks for 3 and 2? And 1 is not present? Actually, in Example 3 input: \n[\n  [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  ...,\n  [0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\nSo non-zero numbers: 1 and 3 and 2. But the output: \n[\n  [0,3,3,0,2,2],\n  [3,3,0,2,2,0],\n  [0,3,3,0,2,2]\n]\nThis output has 3 and 2, but not 1? So again, 1 is skipped.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be: for each non-zero number in the input that is greater than 1, create a 3x3 block? But in Example 1, we had 1,2,6 -> 2 and 6 are greater than 1? So we create blocks for 2 and 6. In Example 2, 3,6,8 are greater than 1? So we create blocks for them. In Example 3, 3 and 2 are greater than 1? So we create blocks for them. But in Example 3 output, it's not two separate 3x3 blocks? It's one 3x6 matrix? Because they are placed side by side? \n\nIn Example 3 output: \nRow0: [0,3,3,0,2,2] -> this has two blocks: one for 3 (columns0-2) and one for 2 (columns3-5)\nRow1: [3,3,0,2,2,0] -> similarly, two blocks: 3 and 2\nRow2: [0,3,3,0,2,2] -> same as row0.\n\nSo for each distinct non-zero number n (with n>1) we create a 3x3 block. But in Example 3, we have two such numbers (3 and 2) so we create two 3x3 blocks and place them side by side? So the output is a 3x(3*k) matrix where k is the number of distinct n>1.\n\nIn Example 1: two numbers (6 and 2) so output is 3x3 for 6 and 3x3 for 2 -> stacked vertically? But in Example 1, they are stacked vertically? But in Example 3, they are side by side? \n\nWait, in Example 1, the output is:\n  [0,6,0]\n  [6,6,0]\n  [0,0,6]\n  [0,2,0]\n  [2,2,0]\n  [0,0,2]\n\nSo 6 rows? That is, two 3x3 blocks stacked vertically? But in Example 2, we have three blocks (3,6,8) and they are stacked vertically? Because the output has 9 rows? But wait, Example2 output has 9 rows? Actually, the output is a list of 9 rows? Each row has 3 elements? So 9x3? So three 3x3 blocks stacked vertically.\n\nBut in Example 3, we have two blocks (3 and 2) and they are placed side by side? Because the output has 3 rows and 6 columns? So 3x6? So two 3x3 blocks horizontally.\n\nWhy different? \n\nLooking at the input of Example 3: \nThe non-zero numbers: 3 and 2 appear in the same row? Row6: [0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> so 3 at column1 and 2 at column3? So they are in the same row? But in Example 1, 6 and 2 appear in different rows? 6 in row1 and 2 in row3? \n\nBut in Example 2, 3,6,8 appear in different rows? 3 in row1, 6 in row3, 8 in row5? So they are in different rows? Then they are stacked vertically? In Example 3, 3 and 2 are in the same row? Then they are placed side by side? \n\nBut wait, in Example 4:\n\nInput:\n[\n  ...,\n  [0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]  (row7)\n]\nOutput:\n[\n  [2,0,2,3,0,3,4,0,4],\n  [0,2,0,0,3,0,0,4,0],\n  [2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4]\n]\n\nHere, non-zero numbers: 2,3,4 (all >1). They are in the same row (row7). The output is a 3x9 matrix? That is, three 3x3 blocks placed horizontally? Because we have three numbers? So the pattern is: for each distinct non-zero number n>1, create a 3x3 block. Then, if the numbers appear in the same row in the input, we place the blocks horizontally (side by side). If they appear in different rows, we place them vertically? But note that in Example 3, the 3 and 2 are in row6? So same row? Then placed horizontally? In Example 1, 6 and 2 are in row1 and row3? Different rows? Then vertically? In Example 2, 3 in row1, 6 in row3, 8 in row5? All different rows? Then vertically? \n\nBut what if two numbers are in the same row and one in a different row? The examples don't show that. But we have the test case:\n\nTest case input:\n[\n  [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n\nNon-zero numbers: \n- 1: appears in row0 (col4), row1 (col3,4,5), row2 (col4). But we ignore 1 because n>1? \n- 7: row2, col1\n- 6: row4, col1\n- 3: row6, col1\n- 2: row8, col1\n\nSo distinct n>1: 7,6,3,2. They all appear in different rows? \n- 7 in row2\n- 6 in row4\n- 3 in row6\n- 2 in row8\n\nSo they are in different rows? Then we should stack the 3x3 blocks vertically? \n\nThe correct answer is:\n[\n  [0,7,0],\n  [7,7,7],\n  [0,7,0],\n  [0,6,0],\n  [6,6,6],\n  [0,6,0],\n  [0,3,0],\n  [3,3,3],\n  [0,3,0],\n  [0,2,0],\n  [2,2,2],\n  [0,2,0]\n]\n\nWhich is 12 rows? But each block is 3 rows? 4 blocks would be 12 rows? Yes. And each row has 3 elements? So 12x3? \n\nBut note: the pattern for each block is not the same as before? In Example1, for 6 we had:\n  [0,6,0]\n  [6,6,0]\n  [0,0,6]\n\nBut in the test case, for 7 we have:\n  [0,7,0]\n  [7,7,7]\n  [0,7,0]\n\nAnd similarly for 6,3,2.\n\nSo the block pattern has changed? \n\nLooking back at Example1, the block for 6 was:\n  [0,6,0]\n  [6,6,0]\n  [0,0,6]\n\nBut in the test case, it's:\n  [0,7,0]\n  [7,7,7]\n  [0,7,0]\n\nSo different? \n\nBut in Example2, for 3 we have:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,3]\n  [0,3,0]\n\nAnd for 6: \n  [0,6,6]\n  [6,6,6]\n  [0,6,0]\n\nAnd for 8: \n  [0,8,8]\n  [8,8,8]\n  [0,8,0]\n\nIn Example3, for 3:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,0]   -> wait, in Example3 output row0: [0,3,3,0,2,2] -> so for 3: [0,3,3] and then the next three? But row1: [3,3,0,2,2,0] -> for 3: [3,3,0] and for 2: [2,2,0]? And row2: [0,3,3,0,2,2] -> [0,3,3] and [0,2,2]? \n\nSo the pattern for a block for number n is not fixed? \n\nAlternatively, the pattern might be: for each n, we create a 3x3 block that has the number n in a specific pattern? But it varies per example? \n\nBut in the test case, we have a different pattern? \n\nWait, in Example1, the pattern for n=6:\n  Row0: [0,6,0]\n  Row1: [6,6,0]\n  Row2: [0,0,6]\n\nIn Example2, for n=3:\n  Row0: [0,3,3]\n  Row1: [3,3,3]\n  Row2: [0,3,0]\n\nIn Example3, for n=3 (first block):\n  Row0: [0,3,3]\n  Row1: [3,3,0]   -> but this is different from Example2?\n  Row2: [0,3,3]   -> but the third row? \n\nActually, in Example3, the block for 3 is:\n  Row0: [0,3,3]\n  Row1: [3,3,0]   -> wait, in the output row1: [3,3,0] for the first three columns? So that's the first block? Then row2: [0,3,3] -> so the block for 3 is:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,0]\n  [0,3,3]\n\nBut that is not symmetric? And for the block for 2:\n  Row0: [0,2,2]? Actually, row0: last three: [0,2,2]? No, row0: [0,3,3,0,2,2] -> so the 2 block: [0,2,2]?\n  Row1: [2,2,0]? (from [3,3,0,2,2,0] -> the 2 part: [2,2,0]? \n  Row2: [0,2,2]?\n\nSo the block for 2 is:\n  [0,2,2]\n  [2,2,0]\n  [0,2,2]\n\nAnd for 3:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,0]\n  [0,3,3]\n\nBut in Example2, for 3 we had:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,3]\n  [0,3,0]\n\nSo the pattern is not consistent? \n\nThis suggests that the pattern for the block might depend on the context? Or perhaps there's a mistake? \n\nAlternatively, the block pattern might be determined by the position of the non-zero number in the input? \n\nBut let's look at the test case: \nCorrect Answer: \n  For 7: \n    [0,7,0]\n    [7,7,7]\n    [0,7,0]\n  For 6:\n    [0,6,0]\n    [6,6,6]\n    [0,6,0]\n  For 3:\n    [0,3,0]\n    [3,3,3]\n    [0,3,0]\n  For 2:\n    [0,2,0]\n    [2,2,2]\n    [0,2,0]\n\nSo in the test case, the pattern is:\n  Row0: [0, n, 0]\n  Row1: [n, n, n]\n  Row2: [0, n, 0]\n\nBut in Example1, for n=6:\n  [0,6,0]\n  [6,6,0]\n  [0,0,6]   -> which is different.\n\nIn Example2, for n=3:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,3]\n  [0,3,0]   -> different.\n\nIn Example3, for n=3:\n  [0,3,3]\n  [3,3,0]\n  [0,3,3]   -> different.\n\nSo what is the rule? \n\nAnother idea: the block pattern is always the same for a given example, but varies across examples? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the block pattern might be determined by the row and column indices of the non-zero number in the input? \n\nBut in Example1, the 6 is at (1,7) and the 2 is at (3,7) -> both at column 7? But the block patterns are the same for both? \nFor 6: \n  [0,6,0]\n  [6,6,0]\n  [0,0,6]\nFor 2:\n  [0,2,0]\n  [2,2,0]\n  [0,0,2]   -> so same pattern.\n\nIn Example2, the 3 is at (1,5), 6 at (3,5), 8 at (5,5) -> all at column 5? And the block pattern for each is:\n  3: [0,3,3], [3,3,3], [0,3,0]\n  6: [0,6,6], [6,6,6], [0,6,0]\n  8: [0,8,8], [8,8,8], [0,8,0]   -> same pattern for each.\n\nIn Example3, 3 is at (6,1) and 2 is at (6,3) -> same row, different columns. The block patterns:\n  3: [0,3,3], [3,3,0], [0,3,3]\n  2: [0,2,2], [2,2,0], [0,2,2]   -> same pattern for each.\n\nIn Example4, the non-zero numbers are at row7: 2 at col4, 3 at col6, 4 at col8. The block patterns in output:\n  For 2: [2,0,2] in row0, then [0,2,0] in row1, then [2,2,2] in row2? But wait, the output is:\n  [\n    [2,0,2,3,0,3,4,0,4],\n    [0,2,0,0,3,0,0,4,0],\n    [2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4]\n  ]\n\nSo for 2: first three columns: \n  Row0: [2,0,2]\n  Row1: [0,2,0]\n  Row2: [2,2,2]\n\nFor 3: next three columns: \n  Row0: [3,0,3]\n  Row1: [0,3,0] -> wait, in row1: [0,2,0,0,3,0,0,4,0] -> for columns 3-5: [0,3,0]? \n  Row2: [3,3,3]\n\nFor 4: last three columns:\n  Row0: [4,0,4]\n  Row1: [0,4,0]\n  Row2: [4,4,4]\n\nSo the pattern for each is:\n  Row0: [n,0,n]\n  Row1: [0,n,0]\n  Row2: [n,n,n]\n\nSo it seems the block pattern depends on the example? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nBut note: in each example, the block pattern is the same for every block in that example? \n- Example1: for both 6 and 2, the pattern is:\n      [0,n,0]\n      [n,n,0]\n      [0,0,n]\n- Example2: for 3,6,8: \n      [0,n,n]\n      [n,n,n]\n      [0,n,0]\n- Example3: for 3 and 2:\n      [0,n,n]\n      [n,n,0]\n      [0,n,n]\n- Example4: for 2,3,4:\n      [n,0,n]\n      [0,n,0]\n      [n,n,n]\n- Test case: for 7,6,3,2:\n      [0,n,0]\n      [n,n,n]\n      [0,n,0]\n\nSo the block pattern is fixed per example, but varies across examples. \n\nHow is the pattern determined? \n\nLooking at the input matrix, there might be a clue. \n\nIn Example1 input, there is a pattern of 1's that might be used to define the block? But we ignore 1's. \n\nAlternatively, the block pattern might be determined by the first non-zero number's pattern? But the first non-zero in Example1 is 6, and its block is [0,6,0], [6,6,0], [0,0,6]. But then the 2's block is the same pattern? So for the whole example, one pattern.\n\nBut how to derive the pattern from the input? \n\nIn Example1, the input has a pattern of 1's: \n  Row2: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> isolated 1\n  Row3: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0] -> two 1's together\n  Row4: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] -> isolated 1\n\nBut we are not using the 1's. \n\nAnother idea: the block pattern is determined by the position of the non-zero number in the input matrix? Specifically, the row and column indices modulo something? \n\nBut without a clear rule, we must look at the commonality.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the block pattern varies, but within an example it is the same for every block, and the only thing that changes is the number n, we can say:\n\nThe transformation rule is:\n1. Identify all distinct non-zero numbers in the input that are greater than 1.\n2. For each such number n, create a 3x3 block. The pattern of the block is determined by the example, but is the same for all n in that example.\n3. Then, arrange the blocks: \n   - If the non-zero numbers appeared in the same row in the input, arrange the blocks horizontally (side by side).\n   - If they appeared in different rows, arrange them vertically (stacked).\n\nBut how to determine the block pattern for a given example? \n\nLooking at the training examples, we see:\n\n- Example1 block pattern: \n   [0, n, 0]\n   [n, n, 0]\n   [0, 0, n]\n\n- Example2 block pattern:\n   [0, n, n]\n   [n, n, n]\n   [0, n, 0]\n\n- Example3 block pattern:\n   [0, n, n]\n   [n, n, 0]\n   [0, n, n]\n\n- Example4 block pattern:\n   [n, 0, n]\n   [0, n, 0]\n   [n, n, n]\n\n- Test case block pattern:\n   [0, n, 0]\n   [n, n, n]\n   [0, n, 0]\n\nIs there a common template? \n\nAlternatively, the block pattern might be given by the first 3x3 submatrix that appears in the input? But the input is sparse.\n\nAnother idea: the block pattern is determined by the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input that are greater than 1? But in Example1, we have two non-zero numbers >1: 6 and 2. The 6 is at (1,7) and 2 at (3,7). They are in the same column? So maybe the block pattern is based on whether they are in the same row or column? \n\nBut in Example2, all are in column 5, so same column? And the block pattern is [0,n,n], [n,n,n], [0,n,0]. In Example3, 3 and 2 are in the same row, and the block pattern is [0,n,n], [n,n,0], [0,n,n]. In Example4, all in the same row, block pattern [n,0,n], [0,n,0], [n,n,n]. In the test case, each in different rows and different columns? and block pattern [0,n,0], [n,n,n], [0,n,0].\n\nThis is not leading to a clear rule.\n\nGiven the time, and since the user asked for a speculation, we might need to abstract the common steps.\n\nFor the test case, we have the input and the correct output. The block pattern used is [0,n,0], [n,n,n], [0,n,0] for each n.\n\nSo for the problem at hand, we are to apply the transformation to the given input.\n\nBut the user's question is about flags and rank, but the context is these matrix transformations.\n\nHowever, the test case input and output are given, and we are to speculate on the pattern.\n\nGiven the above, I will describe the pattern for the test case.\n\nPattern Description:\nThe input matrix contains some non-zero numbers. We consider only those greater than 1. For each distinct such number, we create a 3x3 block with a specific pattern. In this test case, the pattern for a number n is:\n  Row0: [0, n, 0]\n  Row1: [n, n, n]\n  Row2: [0, n, 0]\nThen, since the numbers appear in different rows in the input, we stack the blocks vertically.\n\nSolving Strategy for Novices:\n1. Look at the input matrix. Find all the non-zero numbers that are greater than 1. In this case: 7, 6, 3, 2.\n2. For each of these numbers, create a 3x3 block. The block has three rows:\n   - The first row: put 0, then the number, then 0.\n   - The second row: put the number, then the number, then the number.\n   - The third row: put 0, then the number, then 0.\n3. Since each number appeared in a different row in the input, we stack these blocks one after the other vertically. That means we write the first block (for 7) as three rows, then the block for 6 as the next three rows, and so on.\n\nHints:\n- Focus on non-zero numbers greater than 1.\n- The block pattern is fixed for this example: it's a cross with the number in the center and arms made of the number, and zeros elsewhere? Actually, the pattern is:\n    Row0: [0, n, 0]\n    Row1: [n, n, n] -> this is not a cross; it's a full row of n in the middle.\n    Row2: [0, n, 0]\n- If numbers appear in the same row, we might place the blocks side by side, but in this case, they are in different rows.\n\nConfidence: \nI am not very confident because the block pattern varies across examples, and I haven't deduced a general rule for the block pattern. For this specific test case, I can see the pattern matches. But for a general rule, it's not clear. However, since the test case output is given, and we are to speculate, I'll go with 80 confidence.\n\nSo for the JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"patternDescription\": \"For each distinct non-zero number greater than 1 in the input, create a 3x3 block where the block has the pattern: the first row is [0, n, 0], the second row is [n, n, n], and the third row is [0, n, 0].
