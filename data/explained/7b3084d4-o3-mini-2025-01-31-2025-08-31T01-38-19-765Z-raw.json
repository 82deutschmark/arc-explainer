  "solvingStrategy": "We interpreted the training examples as having been transformed by first isolating the drawn shapes (the non‚Äêzero digits) then cropping the input grid to remove the unnecessary zero margins, and finally ‚Äòresizing‚Äô the cropped image into a smaller square grid. In our approach we assumed that each output cell is computed by considering a block of the cropped input and taking the most frequent nonzero value. In blocks that were entirely background (zeros) the training outputs always showed a replacement (often 5) so we used that as a default. For our test case (a 20√ó20 grid) we cropped to the bounding box that covers all nonzero entries (roughly rows 0‚Äì19 and columns 0‚Äì15) and then partitioned the cropped area into 10√ó10 blocks (using a vertical scale factor of 2 and a non‚Äêuniform horizontal partition based on the crop‚Äôs width) and computed a mode over each block. This produced a 10√ó10 output that preserves the relative placement of the 2‚Äôs, 3‚Äôs, 7‚Äôs, an isolated 5 and 8‚Äôs as seen in the test input.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Locate the non‚Äêzero drawn shapes in the input and determine the minimal bounding box.",
    "Choose an output grid size (10√ó10) consistent with one of the training examples with a 20√ó20 input.",
    "Divide the cropped image into blocks (each block corresponding to approximately 2 rows and a calculated group of columns) and compute the predominant digit in each block.",
    "Replace blocks that are completely zero with the default value (5) observed in the training outputs.",
    "Assemble the output grid so that the spatial relations of the original drawn groups are maintained."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "Crop the input grid to its nonzero bounding region and then scale it down to a square grid by partitioning the region into blocks. Each block‚Äôs output value is determined by the most frequent nonzero digit in that block; blocks that are entirely zero are assigned 5 as a default. This produces a simplified, rescaled version of the original drawing that preserves the relative positioning of the distinct digit‚Äêstrokes.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm (pseudo-code): crop = remove_zero_margins(input); gridSize = 10; for each cell in output grid { block = corresponding region in crop; if block has nonzeros then output_cell = mode(block) else output_cell = 5; }",
    "Math description: Let the cropped input have dimensions H√óW. Partition it into an n√ón grid (here n=10) by setting cell(i,j) = argmax_{d‚â†0} count(d) in the block covering rows [floor(i*H/n), floor((i+1)*H/n)) and columns [floor(j*W/n), floor((j+1)*W/n)); if count = 0 then assign 5.",
