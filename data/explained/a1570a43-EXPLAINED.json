      "reasoningLog": "We observed that in all training examples the border rows containing the digit 3 remain unchanged, and the inner structure made of 2's is redrawn into a smooth, symmetric stroke. In several examples the new cluster of 2's is arranged over a contiguous block of rows, with the top and bottom rows of the cluster containing few 2's and the middle row containing a long horizontal run. In particular, when the border 3's define a horizontal midpoint (computed as the average of the column positions of the 3's – for example, in examples where 3's occur on the left and right edges of the working area), the newly drawn 2‐pattern is centered horizontally around that midpoint. For a cluster spanning five rows (as seen in some examples), the typical pattern becomes: 1 two in the top row, 3 in the next, 5 in the center, then 3 and 1 in the subsequent rows. In our test case the border rows with 3’s are at row1 and row7 and are preserved. The 3’s in these rows are at columns 0 and 6, giving a horizontal center near column 3. Therefore, we redraw the original dispersed 2’s (which originally occupied rows 2–6 with left‐aligned 2’s) into a centered, smooth stroke over five rows. The final output places a single 2 centered at column 3 in the top and bottom rows of the cluster, three consecutive 2’s (columns 2–4) in the rows immediately adjacent, and a full row (columns 1–5) of 2’s in the mid‐row. The remaining rows (beyond the modified inner area) are left as in the input.",

For instance, in the first example, the grid has 9 rows and 10 columns, and the arrangement has changed.

Observing the outputs, the pattern of \"2\" seems to form a diamond shape, and there appears to be a symmetrical arrangement vertically. For the second example, it looks like clusters of \"2\" are systematically rearranged in the output. I need to determine the transformation rules further."

Reflecting the pattern across a vertical axis raises some confusion, as it doesn't mirror perfectly. The output appears to create a continuous stroke from one \"3\" to another, forming a smoothed shape. It looks like I'm on the right track to identify the transformation as a combination of shifts and translations."
