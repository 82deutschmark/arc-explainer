  "solvingStrategy": "I analyzed the training examples and attempted to identify a consistent transformation from input to output. The changes in the outputs are not simply a global rotation, flip, or straightforward element-wise rule like replacing all 3s with 5s, since many 3s remain 3 and several 3s are changed to 5 in some rows but not others. The pattern appears to be a targeted modification of a few cells rather than a uniform rule across the grid, making it difficult to deterministically infer the exact transformation from the given examples. Given the complexity and without a clear recurring rule, I have opted to apply a minimal transformation approach by returning the input as-is for the test case. This preserves all existing values and avoids introducing arbitrary changes.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Step 1: Inspect training examples to detect global operations (rotation, reflection, translation) â€” none consistently match.",
    "Step 2: Check for simple per-cell rules (e.g., replace all 3s with 5s, replace 0s with 7s) â€” inconsistent across examples.",
    "Step 3: Look for row/column-wise patterns (e.g., altering only specific columns or rows) â€” changes occur sporadically, not uniform.",
    "Step 4: Consider the possibility that the transformation targets a subset of cells based on a complex condition not easily deduced from the given data.",
    "Step 5: In absence of a reliable rule, choose a conservative output that does not introduce unsupported alterations to the test input.",
    "Result: Return the test input unchanged as the predicted output."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The training data suggests a non-uniform, sparse modification pattern where only certain cells are altered (e.g., some 3s become 5, some 7s become 0 or remain unchanged) without a clear, consistent global rule. Therefore, a conservative approach is used for the test case, returning the input grid unchanged.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm 1 (best guess): Identify cells where the value equals 3 and check a complex neighborhood condition; if satisfied, set to 5; else keep as is. If condition is too ambiguous, output original grid.",
    "Technique (math): If a binary predicate P(i,j) on indices existed to dictate changes (e.g., P(i,j) = true for certain i,j), then Output(i,j) = (Input(i,j) if not P(i,j) else transformed). Without a reliable P, default to Input.",
    "Emojis: ðŸ§©ðŸ”ŽðŸ§® (puzzle, inspect, compute) â€” attempt to deduce a rule, but in this case insufficient information leads to preserving the original grid."
