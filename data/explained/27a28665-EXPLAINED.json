The output is the count of filled neighbors. Validate against training: Examples 1 and 6 (cross without corners) have 4 neighbors -> output 1? That seems off. Re-examine: The outputs are not raw counts, but appear to be mapping counts to smaller digits: For cross shape (up,down,left,right filled) the outputs are 1. For full X (four corners) plus center? Wait analyze each example precisely using neighbor-count mapping to a code:\\n- Define positions: N=(0,1), S=(2,1), W=(1,0), E=(1,2), NW=(0,0), NE=(0,2), SW=(2,0), SE=(2,2), C=(1,1).\\n- Example1 [[5,5,0],[5,0,5],[0,5,0]] nonzeros at N,W,E,S (cross), corners mostly zeros; center 0. Output 1.\\n- Example6 similarly with value 4 same pattern -> 1. So pattern class 'cross of 4' -> 1.\\n- Example2 [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]] nonzeros at corners NW, NE, SW, SE and center C; edges N,S,E,W are 0. Output 2.\\n- Example3 [[5,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,5]] identical pattern (corners + center) -> 2.\\n- Example4 [[0,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0]] nonzeros at positions: NE,E, C, S? Let's list: Row0 col1=1 (N), row0 col2=1 (NE), row1 col1=1 (C), row1 col2=1 (E), row2 col0=1 (SW). That seems like an L-block of 5 cells? Output 3. Example5 is same shape but with 8s -> 3. So pattern class '2x2 block at top-right including center' plus one at SW? Alternatively it matches a 2x2 block spanning N, NE, C, E (i.e., quadrant block at NE) plus a single at SW. Output 3. Example7 [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]] nonzeros at N,S,E,W and C (a plus with center). Output 6.\\nHypothesis: Output encodes the count of filled among the 5 key positions: cross-only=4 -> 1, corners+center=5 -> 2, NE quadrant 2x2 block (N,NE,E,C) plus SW (5 filled but different configuration) -> 3, plus shape with center and 4 arms (5 filled) -> 6. So not a simple count. Another hypothesis: The digit equals number of connected components or symmetry class index.\\nCheck symmetry: \\n- Cross without center has 4-connectivity forming one component ring-like? Actually the four arms are disconnected (since center 0), but using 4-neighbor connectivity, N,W,E,S are separated by one cell apart; none touch. That's 4 components. Output 1 doesn't match count 4.\\n- Corners+center: Four corners are 4-connected to the center? No, corners are only diagonally adjacent to center, which is not 4-connected, so each corner is its own component plus the center: 5 components. Output 2. Not a linear mapping.\\nPerhaps the outputs are labels: 1 for cross-edges only; 2 for corners+center; 3 for NE 2x2 block + SW; 6 for plus with center.\\nTherefore apply classification to tests by matching shapes.\\nTest1 [[0,8,0],[8,8,8],[0,8,0]] is the plus with center (N,S,E,W,C all filled). This matches Example7 -> output 6.\\nTest2 [[7,7,0],[7,0,7],[0,7,0]] matches Example1/6 rotated? It's the cross without center with three arms? Let's list positions nonzero: (0,0)=NW, (0,1)=N, (1,0)=W, (1,2)=E, (2,1)=S, (2,0)=SW. That's 6 filled including two corners NW and SW, and four edges N,W,E,S, center 0. That does not match prior exactly. But compare to Example1 which had only N,W,E,S (4). Here we have added two adjacent corners on the left column. Is there any training example mapping for this? None.\\nMaybe rule instead: Output equals number of unique colors used? No, all have single nonzero color plus zeros; outputs differ 1,2,3,6. So not count of colors.\\nAlternate idea: The output is the number representing which digit the pattern resembles on a seven-segment or digital clock? \\n- Cross without center looks like digit 1? Unlikely.\\n- Corners+center looks like 2? The pattern of corners + center could resemble an X with a dot, maybe 2? \\n- Example7 plus looks like 6? Plus sign resembles 5-way star equals 6? Hmm.\\nAnother angle: Maybe they count how many of the 3x3 cells are nonzero and map via hash to digits: counts: \\nEx1: 4 nonzeros -> outputs 1.\\nEx6: also 4 -> 1. Good.\\nEx2: corners+center = 5 nonzeros -> output 2. Ex3 also 5 -> 2. Good.\\nEx4: cells: N, NE, C, E, SW = 5 nonzeros -> output 3. Ex5 same -> 3. So for 5 nonzeros, outputs can be 2 or 3 depending on arrangement. Thus arrangement matters beyond count.\\nObserve parity by diagonals: Ex2/3 have center and all four corners (no edge cells). Ex4/5 have a 2x2 block at top-right (N,NE,E,C) plus a single SW. These seem like two distinct 5-cell shapes mapping to 2 and 3 respectively.\\nFor Test2 shape has 6 nonzeros (edges N,S,E,W and corners NW,SW). No training for 6 except Example7 has 5 nonzeros and outputs 6, which breaks any monotonic mapping. However Example7 output equals 6 even though 5 nonzeros. Thus the digit is a class label not count.\\nWe need infer a rule producing these labels: perhaps it's the index of which line (row/column/diag) is fully filled count.\\nCompute number of full lines (rows, cols, diags) that are fully nonzero:\\n- Ex1: No full row; col1 (middle column) has [5,0,5] not full; row1 etc. Diagonals? main diag [5,0,0] not full; anti [0,0,0]. Zero full lines. Output 1.\\n- Ex6 same -> 1. \\n- Ex2: rows: row0 [8,0,8] not full; row1 [0,8,0] not; row2 [8,0,8] not. Cols: col0 [8,0,8] not; col1 [0,8,0] not; col2 [8,0,8] not. Diagonals: main [8,8,8] yes full; anti [8,8,8] yes full. Two full diagonals -> output 2. \\n- Ex3 same -> 2. \\n- Ex4: rows: row0 [0,1,1] not full; row1 [0,1,1] not; row2 [1,0,0] not. Cols: col0 [0,0,1] not; col1 [1,1,0] not; col2 [1,1,0] not. Diagonals: main [0,1,0] not; anti [1,1,1] full (anti-diagonal). That's 1 full line -> but output is 3. Hmm. Count of full lines equals 1, not 3. Maybe count of cells along full lines? Anti-diagonal length 3 -> 3. That matches output 3. Check Ex5: anti-diagonal is [8,8,8] full -> length 3 -> output 3. Ex2: both diagonals full; total cells covered by full lines maybe 5 (but double-count center), 3+3-1=5, yet output 2. So not this.\\nBut maybe the rule is: Number of full diagonals -> output 2 when both; 3 when exactly one anti-diagonal; 1 when none. That matches: Ex1 none -> 1; Ex6 none ->1; Ex2 both ->2; Ex3 both ->2; Ex4 anti only ->3; Ex5 anti only ->3; Ex7 plus with center: diagonals? main [0,5,0] not; anti [0,5,0] not -> none; output 6, which doesn't fit. However maybe for plus shape there is a full cross (row1 and col1 are full): row1 [5,5,5] full and col1 [5,5,5] full -> both middle row and middle column are fully nonzero, giving a special label 6. That could be consistent if labels correspond to which pair of orthogonal lines are full:\\n- If both diagonals full -> label 2.\\n- If anti-diagonal full only -> label 3.\\n- If middle row and middle column full -> label 6.\\n- If none of the lines (rows/cols/diags) are fully filled -> label 1.\\nCheck these on examples: Ex1/6 none full -> 1 OK. Ex2/3 both diagonals -> 2 OK. Ex4/5 anti only -> 3 OK. Ex7 middle row and middle column both full -> 6 OK.\\nTherefore the task is: determine which specific line(s) of length 3 are fully nonzero, and map to label: none=1, both diagonals=2, anti only=3, middle row+col=6.\\nApply to tests:\\nTest1 plus with center: row1 and col1 full -> label 6.\\nTest2 pattern: rows? row0 [7,7,0] not full; row1 [7,0,7] not; row2 [0,7,0] not. Cols: col0 [7,7,0] not; col1 [7,0,7] not; col2 [0,7,0] not. Diagonals: main [7,0,0] not; anti [0,0,0] not. So none full -> label 1.\\nTest3 corners+center: both diagonals full -> label 2.\",\"keySteps\":[\"Catalog nonzero positions for each training example and observe which complete lines (rows, columns, or diagonals) are fully nonzero.\",\"Identify mapping from specific fully-filled line configurations to output labels: none -> 1; both diagonals -> 2; anti-diagonal only -> 3; middle row and column both -> 6.\",\"Verify mapping across all training examples for consistency.\",\"Apply mapping to each test input: detect fully nonzero lines and map to the corresponding label.\"],\"patternDescription\":\"Given a 3x3 grid with single nonzero color, determine which of the 8 straight lines of length 3 (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals) are completely filled (all three cells nonzero).

      "solvingStrategy": "Interpret each 3x3 grid as indicating which of the 8 neighbor positions around the center are filled (nonzero). The output is the count of filled neighbors. Validate against training: Examples 1 and 6 (cross without corners) have 4 neighbors -> output 1? That seems off. Re-examine: The outputs are not raw counts, but appear to be mapping counts to smaller digits: For cross shape (up,down,left,right filled) the outputs are 1. For full X (four corners) plus center? Wait analyze each example precisely using neighbor-count mapping to a code:\n- Define positions: N=(0,1), S=(2,1), W=(1,0), E=(1,2), NW=(0,0), NE=(0,2), SW=(2,0), SE=(2,2), C=(1,1).\n- Example1 [[5,5,0],[5,0,5],[0,5,0]] nonzeros at N,W,E,S (cross), corners mostly zeros; center 0. Output 1.\n- Example6 similarly with value 4 same pattern -> 1. So pattern class 'cross of 4' -> 1.\n- Example2 [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]] nonzeros at corners NW, NE, SW, SE and center C; edges N,S,E,W are 0. Output 2.\n- Example3 [[5,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,5]] identical pattern (corners + center) -> 2.\n- Example4 [[0,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0]] nonzeros at positions: NE,E, C, S? Let's list: Row0 col1=1 (N), row0 col2=1 (NE), row1 col1=1 (C), row1 col2=1 (E), row2 col0=1 (SW). That seems like an L-block of 5 cells? Output 3. Example5 is same shape but with 8s -> 3. So pattern class '2x2 block at top-right including center' plus one at SW? Alternatively it matches a 2x2 block spanning N, NE, C, E (i.e., quadrant block at NE) plus a single at SW. Output 3. Example7 [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]] nonzeros at N,S,E,W and C (a plus with center). Output 6.\nHypothesis: Output encodes the count of filled among the 5 key positions: cross-only=4 -> 1, corners+center=5 -> 2, NE quadrant 2x2 block (N,NE,E,C) plus SW (5 filled but different configuration) -> 3, plus shape with center and 4 arms (5 filled) -> 6. So not a simple count. Another hypothesis: The digit equals number of connected components or symmetry class index.\nCheck symmetry: \n- Cross without center has 4-connectivity forming one component ring-like? Actually the four arms are disconnected (since center 0), but using 4-neighbor connectivity, N,W,E,S are separated by one cell apart; none touch. That's 4 components. Output 1 doesn't match count 4.\n- Corners+center: Four corners are 4-connected to the center? No, corners are only diagonally adjacent to center, which is not 4-connected, so each corner is its own component plus the center: 5 components. Output 2. Not a linear mapping.\nPerhaps the outputs are labels: 1 for cross-edges only; 2 for corners+center; 3 for NE 2x2 block + SW; 6 for plus with center.\nTherefore apply classification to tests by matching shapes.\nTest1 [[0,8,0],[8,8,8],[0,8,0]] is the plus with center (N,S,E,W,C all filled). This matches Example7 -> output 6.\nTest2 [[7,7,0],[7,0,7],[0,7,0]] matches Example1/6 rotated? It's the cross without center with three arms? Let's list positions nonzero: (0,0)=NW, (0,1)=N, (1,0)=W, (1,2)=E, (2,1)=S, (2,0)=SW. That's 6 filled including two corners NW and SW, and four edges N,W,E,S, center 0. That does not match prior exactly. But compare to Example1 which had only N,W,E,S (4). Here we have added two adjacent corners on the left column. Is there any training example mapping for this? None.\nMaybe rule instead: Output equals number of unique colors used? No, all have single nonzero color plus zeros; outputs differ 1,2,3,6. So not count of colors.\nAlternate idea: The output is the number representing which digit the pattern resembles on a seven-segment or digital clock? \n- Cross without center looks like digit 1? Unlikely.\n- Corners+center looks like 2? The pattern of corners + center could resemble an X with a dot, maybe 2? \n- Example7 plus looks like 6? Plus sign resembles 5-way star equals 6? Hmm.\nAnother angle: Maybe they count how many of the 3x3 cells are nonzero and map via hash to digits: counts: \nEx1: 4 nonzeros -> outputs 1.\nEx6: also 4 -> 1. Good.\nEx2: corners+center = 5 nonzeros -> output 2. Ex3 also 5 -> 2. Good.\nEx4: cells: N, NE, C, E, SW = 5 nonzeros -> output 3. Ex5 same -> 3. So for 5 nonzeros, outputs can be 2 or 3 depending on arrangement. Thus arrangement matters beyond count.\nObserve parity by diagonals: Ex2/3 have center and all four corners (no edge cells). Ex4/5 have a 2x2 block at top-right (N,NE,E,C) plus a single SW. These seem like two distinct 5-cell shapes mapping to 2 and 3 respectively.\nFor Test2 shape has 6 nonzeros (edges N,S,E,W and corners NW,SW). No training for 6 except Example7 has 5 nonzeros and outputs 6, which breaks any monotonic mapping. However Example7 output equals 6 even though 5 nonzeros. Thus the digit is a class label not count.\nWe need infer a rule producing these labels: perhaps it's the index of which line (row/column/diag) is fully filled count.\nCompute number of full lines (rows, cols, diags) that are fully nonzero:\n- Ex1: No full row; col1 (middle column) has [5,0,5] not full; row1 etc. Diagonals? main diag [5,0,0] not full; anti [0,0,0]. Zero full lines. Output 1.\n- Ex6 same -> 1. \n- Ex2: rows: row0 [8,0,8] not full; row1 [0,8,0] not; row2 [8,0,8] not. Cols: col0 [8,0,8] not; col1 [0,8,0] not; col2 [8,0,8] not. Diagonals: main [8,8,8] yes full; anti [8,8,8] yes full. Two full diagonals -> output 2. \n- Ex3 same -> 2. \n- Ex4: rows: row0 [0,1,1] not full; row1 [0,1,1] not; row2 [1,0,0] not. Cols: col0 [0,0,1] not; col1 [1,1,0] not; col2 [1,1,0] not. Diagonals: main [0,1,0] not; anti [1,1,1] full (anti-diagonal). That's 1 full line -> but output is 3. Hmm. Count of full lines equals 1, not 3. Maybe count of cells along full lines? Anti-diagonal length 3 -> 3. That matches output 3. Check Ex5: anti-diagonal is [8,8,8] full -> length 3 -> output 3. Ex2: both diagonals full; total cells covered by full lines maybe 5 (but double-count center), 3+3-1=5, yet output 2. So not this.\nBut maybe the rule is: Number of full diagonals -> output 2 when both; 3 when exactly one anti-diagonal; 1 when none. That matches: Ex1 none -> 1; Ex6 none ->1; Ex2 both ->2; Ex3 both ->2; Ex4 anti only ->3; Ex5 anti only ->3; Ex7 plus with center: diagonals? main [0,5,0] not; anti [0,5,0] not -> none; output 6, which doesn't fit. However maybe for plus shape there is a full cross (row1 and col1 are full): row1 [5,5,5] full and col1 [5,5,5] full -> both middle row and middle column are fully nonzero, giving a special label 6. That could be consistent if labels correspond to which pair of orthogonal lines are full:\n- If both diagonals full -> label 2.\n- If anti-diagonal full only -> label 3.\n- If middle row and middle column full -> label 6.\n- If none of the lines (rows/cols/diags) are fully filled -> label 1.\nCheck these on examples: Ex1/6 none full -> 1 OK. Ex2/3 both diagonals -> 2 OK. Ex4/5 anti only -> 3 OK. Ex7 middle row and middle column both full -> 6 OK.\nTherefore the task is: determine which specific line(s) of length 3 are fully nonzero, and map to label: none=1, both diagonals=2, anti only=3, middle row+col=6.\nApply to tests:\nTest1 plus with center: row1 and col1 full -> label 6.\nTest2 pattern: rows? row0 [7,7,0] not full; row1 [7,0,7] not; row2 [0,7,0] not. Cols: col0 [7,7,0] not; col1 [7,0,7] not; col2 [0,7,0] not. Diagonals: main [7,0,0] not; anti [0,0,0] not. So none full -> label 1.\nTest3 corners+center: both diagonals full -> label 2.",
