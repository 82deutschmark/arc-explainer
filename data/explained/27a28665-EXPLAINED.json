      "reasoningLog": "First, I am considering the task: I need to analyze the training examples and predict the output for the test cases. The output is always a single number in a 1x1 grid, like [[3]], [[6]], etc. So, for each input grid, there's a transformation that results in a single number.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples:\n\n- Example 1: Input [[0,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0]] → Output [[3]]\n\n- Example 2: Input [[0,8,8],[0,8,8],[8,0,0]] → Output [[3]]\n\n- Example 3: Input [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]] → Output [[6]]\n\n- Example 4: Input [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]] → Output [[2]]\n\n- Example 5: Input [[5,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,5]] → Output [[2]]\n\n- Example 6: Input [[4,4,0],[4,0,4],[0,4,0]] → Output [[1]]\n\n- Example 7: Input [[5,5,0],[5,0,5],[0,5,0]] → Output [[1]]\n\nI notice that in examples 1 and 2, the output is the same (3) even though the numbers are different (1 and 8). Similarly, examples 4 and 5 have output 2 with different numbers (8 and 5). Examples 6 and 7 have output 1 with numbers 4 and 5.\n\nThe numbers in the input seem to vary, but the pattern might be based on the arrangement or something else.\n\nLet me look at the grid shapes. All inputs are 3x3 grids. The output is a single number.\n\nPerhaps it's counting something or performing an operation based on the values.\n\nNotice that in example 1: [[0,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0]] → 3\n\nExample 2: similar pattern with 8 instead of 1.\n\nIn example 3: [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]] → 6, which looks like a plus sign.\n\nExample 4: [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]] → 2, which is like an X pattern.\n\nExample 5: same as example 4 but with 5.\n\nExample 6: [[4,4,0],[4,0,4],[0,4,0]] → 1\n\nExample 7: [[5,5,0],[5,0,5],[0,5,0]] → 1\n\nExamples 6 and 7 seem similar but with different numbers.\n\nMaybe the output is related to the number of distinct values or something.\n\nList the inputs and outputs:\n\n- Ex1: Input has 0 and 1, output 3\n\n- Ex2: Input has 0 and 8, output 3\n\n- Ex3: Input has 0 and 5, output 6\n\n- Ex4: Input has 0 and 8, output 2\n\n- Ex5: Input has 0 and 5, output 2\n\n- Ex6: Input has 0 and 4, output 1\n\n- Ex7: Input has 0 and 5, output 1\n\nThe non-zero numbers are different, but output varies.\n\nPerhaps it's the sum or something, but let's calculate sums.\n\nEx1: sum of all elements: 0+1+1 + 0+1+1 + 1+0+0 = 5, but output is 3, not sum.\n\nMaybe sum of non-zero elements.\n\nEx1: non-zero are 1,1,1,1,1 — five 1's, sum=5, but output 3. Not sum.\n\nPerhaps count of something.\n\nNotice that in ex1 and ex2, the pattern is similar: first two rows have the same pattern, last row different. But output is 3.\n\nIn ex1: positions with 1: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — that's 5 positions, but output 3.\n\nNot count of 1's.\n\nMaybe it's the number of connected components or something, but that might be complex.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is based on the shape formed by the non-zero values.\n\nIn ex1, non-zero values form a sort of L-shape or something.\n\nList the non-zero positions:\n\nEx1: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — this looks like a block in the top-right and one in bottom-left, but not connected? (3,1) is isolated from the top-right block if we consider adjacency. In grid terms, (2,2) and (3,1) are not adjacent (diagonally adjacent, but usually in grid problems, adjacency is up, down, left, right, not diagonal).\n\nAssume 4-connectivity for simplicity.\n\nIn ex1: non-zero cells: row1 col2 and col3, row2 col2 and col3, row3 col1.\n\n(1,2) and (1,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\n(1,2) and (2,2) are adjacent vertically.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) and (2,3).\n\nBut (2,2) and (3,1) are not adjacent (diagonally separate).\n\nSo perhaps two components: one with 4 cells (top-right 2x2 block minus (2,3)? No, (1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3) are all connected, that's one component of size 4, and (3,1) is another of size 1. But output is 3, not 2 or something.\n\nNot matching.\n\nPerhaps it's the number of \"corners\" or something.\n\nAnother thought: look at the values. In ex1 and ex2, the non-zero value is the same (1 or 8), and output is 3.\n\nIn ex3, non-zero is 5, output 6.\n\nIn ex4, non-zero is 8, output 2.\n\nIn ex5, non-zero is 5, output 2.\n\nIn ex6, non-zero is 4, output 1.\n\nIn ex7, non-zero is 5, output 1.\n\nSo the output doesn't seem directly related to the value, since same value can give different outputs (ex3 and ex7 both have 5, but outputs 6 and 1).\n\nSo it must be the pattern.\n\nNotice that in ex1 and ex2, the input has a specific pattern: the first two rows have the same values in columns 2 and 3, and the third row has a value only in column 1. Specifically, for ex1: row1: [0,1,1], row2: [0,1,1], row3: [1,0,0] — so it's like a right-hand side and a bottom-left.\n\nBut output is 3.\n\nIn ex3: [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]] — this is a plus sign, centered, output 6.\n\nIn ex4: [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]] — this is an X, output 2.\n\nIn ex5: same as ex4 with 5, output 2.\n\nIn ex6: [[4,4,0],[4,0,4],[0,4,0]] — let's see the pattern. Row1: two 4's on left, row2: 4 on left and right, row3: one 4 in middle. It looks like a pattern.\n\nPerhaps the output is the number of times the non-zero value appears in a certain configuration.\n\nMaybe it's the sum of the values in specific positions.\n\nLet's list all inputs and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nPerhaps the output is the count of cells that are equal to the majority value or something.\n\nIn ex1, most cells are 1, but there are 5 ones, output 3, not 5.\n\nNot count.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's the minimum number of moves to make all non-zero cells the same or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nLet's look at the patterns geometrically.\n\nNotice that in ex1 and ex2, the non-zero cells are in positions that form a specific shape. Ex1: cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1). If we consider the grid, it's not symmetric.\n\nPerhaps the output is related to the number of \"edges\" or something.\n\nMaybe it's the value from a mathematical operation.\n\nLet's calculate the product or other operations.\n\nEx1: product of all elements is 0, since there are zeros, not useful.\n\nPerhaps only non-zero elements.\n\nEx1: product of non-zero is 1*1*1*1*1 =1, not 3.\n\nNot product.\n\nSum of non-zero: ex1 sum=5, output 3.\n\nDifference or something.\n\nPerhaps it's the number of unique rows or columns, but let's see.\n\nEx1: rows are [0,1,1], [0,1,1], [1,0,0] — unique rows: two types, output 3, not 2.\n\nNot that.\n\nColumns: col1: [0,0,1], col2: [1,1,0], col3: [1,1,0] — unique columns: two types, output 3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother thought: in all examples, the input has only two distinct values: 0 and some other number, say N. And the output is a number that might depend on N and the pattern.\n\nBut in ex3, N=5, output 6; ex4, N=8, output 2; etc.\n\nPerhaps the output is the count of cells where the value is equal to the value in the center cell or something.\n\nIn ex1, center cell is (2,2) which is 1, and cells with value 1 are 5, but output 3.\n\nNot that.\n\nIn ex3, center cell is (2,2)=5, cells with value 5 are 5 cells (all non-zero), output 6, not 5.\n\nNot that.\n\nPerhaps it's the sum of the values in the corners or something.\n\nEx1: corners are (1,1)=0, (1,3)=1, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=0, sum=2, not 3.\n\nNot that.\n\nMaybe it's the number of cells that are not zero and have a specific property.\n\nLet's list the non-zero positions for each example and see if there's a pattern in the output.\n\nEx1: non-zero at (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — output 3\n\nEx2: similar, with 8, output 3\n\nEx3: non-zero at (1,2)=5, (2,1)=5, (2,2)=5, (2,3)=5, (3,2)=5 — so positions: row1 col2, row2 col1,2,3, row3 col2 — output 6\n\nEx4: non-zero at (1,1)=8, (1,3)=8, (2,2)=8, (3,1)=8, (3,3)=8 — output 2\n\nEx5: same as ex4 with 5, output 2\n\nEx6: non-zero at (1,1)=4, (1,2)=4, (2,1)=4, (2,3)=4, (3,2)=4 — output 1\n\nEx7: non-zero at (1,1)=5, (1,2)=5, (2,1)=5, (2,3)=5, (3,2)=5 — output 1\n\nNow, for ex6 and ex7, the non-zero positions are the same: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — and output 1 for both.\n\nFor ex4 and ex5, non-zero at (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) — output 2.\n\nFor ex3, non-zero at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) — output 6.\n\nFor ex1 and ex2, non-zero at (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — output 3.\n\nNow, the number of non-zero cells is 5 for all examples except... ex3 has 5 non-zero, output 6; ex4 has 5, output 2; etc. All have 5 non-zero cells? Let's check.\n\nEx1: 5 non-zero, output 3\n\nEx2: 5 non-zero, output 3\n\nEx3: 5 non-zero, output 6\n\nEx4: 5 non-zero, output 2\n\nEx5: 5 non-zero, output 2\n\nEx6: 5 non-zero, output 1\n\nEx7: 5 non-zero, output 1\n\nAll inputs have exactly 5 non-zero cells? In a 3x3 grid, 5 non-zero.\n\nEx1: 5 ones, ex2: 5 eights, ex3: 5 fives, ex4: 5 eights, ex5: 5 fives, ex6: 5 fours, ex7: 5 fives. Yes, all have 5 non-zero cells.\n\nBut output varies: 3,3,6,2,2,1,1.\n\nSo the output is not the count of non-zero cells, since it's always 5 but output different.\n\nPerhaps the output is the value of N times something, but N varies, output doesn't scale with N.\n\nIn ex3, N=5, output 6; in ex7, N=5, output 1; so not related to N.\n\nSo it must be the pattern of the non-zero cells.\n\nNow, let's see the patterns.\n\nFor ex1 and ex2: non-zero at (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — this looks like a right-hand block and a left-bottom cell.\n\nPerhaps the output is the number of \"connected components\" in terms of adjacency.\n\nIn ex1: cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3) are all connected (4-neighborhood), and (3,1) is separate, so two components, but output is 3, not 2.\n\nIf we consider 8-neighborhood, (2,2) and (3,1) are diagonally adjacent, so all might be connected. In 8-neighborhood, (2,2) is adjacent to (3,1) diagonally, so all non-zero cells are connected: from (1,2) to (1,3), to (2,3), to (2,2), to (3,1) via (2,2) and (3,1) adjacent. So one component, but output 3, not 1.\n\nNot that.\n\nPerhaps the output is the sum of the row indices or column indices of non-zero cells or something.\n\nEx1: row indices: for non-zero, rows 1,1,2,2,3 — sum =1+1+2+2+3=9, not 3.\n\nColumn indices: 2,3,2,3,1 — sum=2+3+2+3+1=11, not 3.\n\nNot that.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the number of times the pattern matches a specific template or something.\n\nNotice that in ex3, the pattern is a plus sign, and output is 6.\n\nIn ex4, it's an X, output 2.\n\nIn ex6 and ex7, the pattern is similar to ex4 but different. Ex6: non-zero at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — this is not a standard pattern. Let's visualize.\n\nEx6: row1: [4,4,0] so left two cells\n\nRow2: [4,0,4] so left and right\n\nRow3: [0,4,0] so middle\n\nSo it's like a cross but not centered; actually, it's missing the center cell? In ex6, (2,2) is 0, so it's not a full cross.\n\nSimilarly, ex7 same.\n\nEx4 has (2,2) non-zero, ex6 has (2,2) zero.\n\nPerhaps the output is related to whether the center cell is non-zero or not.\n\nIn ex3, center is non-zero, output 6\n\nEx4, center non-zero, output 2\n\nEx5, center non-zero, output 2\n\nEx1, center is non-zero (2,2)=1, output 3\n\nEx2, center non-zero, output 3\n\nEx6, center is zero, output 1\n\nEx7, center is zero, output 1\n\nSo when center is non-zero, output can be 3,6,2; when center is zero, output is 1.\n\nBut not consistent, because ex3 output 6, ex4 output 2, both center non-zero.\n\nSo not just that.\n\nPerhaps the output is the number of non-zero cells in the perimeter or something.\n\nEx1: perimeter cells are row1, row3, col1, col3. Non-zero in perimeter: (1,2), (1,3), (3,1) — that's 3 cells, and output is 3. Oh!\n\nLet's check other examples.\n\nEx1: non-zero in perimeter: (1,2), (1,3), (3,1) — yes, 3 cells, output 3.\n\nEx2: same, non-zero in perimeter: (1,2), (1,3), (3,1) — 3 cells, output 3.\n\nEx3: non-zero in perimeter: row1 col2, row2 col1 and col3, row3 col2 — so (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — that's 4 cells, but output is 6, not 4. Not matching.\n\nPerimeter typically means the outer cells, so for 3x3, all cells except center are perimeter? No, in grid terms, perimeter usually means the boundary cells.\n\nFor a 3x3 grid, the perimeter cells are all cells where row=1 or row=3 or col=1 or col=3, so 8 cells: corners and edges.\n\nIn ex3, non-zero in perimeter: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — all are perimeter except (2,2) which is center. So 4 non-zero in perimeter, but output is 6, not 4.\n\nNot that.\n\nPerhaps it's the number of non-zero cells that are on the edge but not the corner or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is the value from the cell that is most common or something.\n\nLet's think differently. Notice that in ex3, output is 6, and the non-zero value is 5, not related.\n\nPerhaps the output is the sum of the values in the cells that are not zero, but divided by something. Ex1 sum=5, output 3, not integer division.\n\n5/1.666? Not.\n\nMaybe it's the number of cells with a specific color, but all non-zero are the same value in each example.\n\nIn ex1, all non-zero are 1, output 3.\n\nIn ex3, all non-zero are 5, output 6.\n\nIn ex4, all non-zero are 8, output 2.\n\nIn ex6, all non-zero are 4, output 1.\n\nSo the output is not the value, but perhaps a function of the pattern.\n\nLet's list the positions of non-zero cells for each example and see the output.\n\nEx1: positions: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — output 3\n\nEx2: same, output 3\n\nEx3: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) — output 6\n\nEx4: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) — output 2\n\nEx5: same, output 2\n\nEx6: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — output 1\n\nEx7: same, output 1\n\nNow, for test cases, we have three inputs.\n\nTest 1: [[7,7,0],[7,0,7],[0,7,0]] — so non-zero at (1,1)=7, (1,2)=7, (2,1)=7, (2,3)=7, (3,2)=7 — so positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nThis looks similar to ex6 and ex7, which have output 1.\n\nEx6: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — yes, exactly the same pattern as test 1.\n\nIn ex6, value is 4, output 1; ex7 value 5, output 1; so for test 1, value 7, but pattern same, so output should be 1.\n\nSimilarly, test 2: [[0,8,0],[8,8,8],[0,8,0]] — non-zero at (1,2)=8, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=8, (2,3)=8, (3,2)=8 — so (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nThis is exactly the same as ex3, which had output 6.\n\nEx3: input [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]] — yes, non-zero at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), output 6.\n\nSo for test 2, output should be 6.\n\nTest 3: [[2,0,2],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]] — non-zero at (1,1)=2, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=2, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=2 — so (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)\n\nThis is the same as ex4 and ex5, which had output 2.\n\nEx4: [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]] — non-zero at (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), output 2.\n\nEx5 same with 5, output 2.\n\nSo for test 3, output should be 2.\n\nNow, to confirm, in ex1 and ex2, the pattern is different: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) — output 3.\n\nBut in the test cases, we have patterns matching ex3, ex4, ex6.\n\nSo for each test case, the output should be based on the pattern of non-zero positions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Pattern like ex3: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) → output 6\n\n- Pattern like ex4: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) → output 2\n\n- Pattern like ex6: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) → output 1\n\nAnd for ex1: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) → output 3\n\nBut in test cases, we don't have that pattern.\n\nTest 1 matches ex6 pattern, so output 1\n\nTest 2 matches ex3 pattern, output 6\n\nTest 3 matches ex4 pattern, output 2\n\nNow, is there a reason why ex3 output is 6? Perhaps it's the sum of something, but in ex3, all non-zero are 5, but output 6, not 5.\n\nMaybe it's not the value, but the pattern itself defines the output number.\n\nIn ex3, the pattern is a plus sign, and output is 6, which might be arbitrary.\n\nSimilarly, ex4 output 2 for X pattern.\n\nEx6 output 1 for that pattern.\n\nAnd ex1 output 3 for its pattern.\n\nBut since the test cases match existing patterns, we can directly map.\n\nFor test 1: input [[7,7,0],[7,0,7],[0,7,0]] which is identical pattern to ex6 and ex7, so output should be [[1]]\n\nTest 2: input [[0,8,0],[8,8,8],[0,8,0]] identical to ex3, output [[6]]\n\nTest 3: input [[2,0,2],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]] identical to ex4 and ex5, output [[2]]\n\nSo the predicted outputs are [[1]], [[6]], [[2]] for test 1,2,3 respectively.\n\nNow, for the JSON response, since there are multiple test cases, I need to set \"multiplePredictedOutputs\" to true, and then have \"predictedOutput1\", \"predictedOutput2\", \"predictedOutput3\".\n\nAlso, in the solvingStrategy, I need to explain my reasoning.\n\nSo, patternDescription: The output is determined by the spatial pattern of non-zero cells in the 3x3 grid, and specific patterns correspond to fixed output values regardless of the non-zero number.\n\nKeySteps: I identified that all training examples have exactly 5 non-zero cells, and the output varies based on their positions. By comparing the patterns, I matched test cases to training examples.\n\nHints: The non-zero value itself doesn't affect the output; only the pattern matters. Test cases directly correspond to existing patterns in training.\n\nConfidence: High, since the patterns are identical.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure.\n\nFirst field: \"multiplePredictedOutputs\": true\n\nThen \"predictedOutput1\": [[1]]\n\n\"predictedOutput2\": [[6]]\n\n\"predictedOutput3\": [[2]]\n\nThen other fields like solvingStrategy, etc.\n\nIn solvingStrategy, I should put the detailed reasoning.\n\nAlso, ensure JSON is valid.",
