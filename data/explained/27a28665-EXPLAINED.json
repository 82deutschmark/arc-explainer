      "reasoningLog": "The training examples provide a set of 3x3 input grids with numeric values and an associated single-value output inside a single cell list. I analyzed the data by comparing each input grid's pattern and the corresponding output. The inputs contain blocks of similar numbers arranged in somewhat symmetric patterns. The outputs appear to relate directly to counting occurrences of a particular key number in specific spatial arrangements. For example, when a pattern forms a cross or plus shape of a color/value, the output reflects how many of those key color cells participate in the cross shape. For example, in example 3, the plus shape of '5's yields output 6, which matches the count of '5's forming the cross plus center. In another set, patterns around the center or diagonal produce smaller counts representing a subset of the blocks. The general pattern is: The output is the count of cells equal to the dominant color/value forming a specific repeated symmetric shape in the grid. In test 1: input [[7,7,0],[7,0,7],[0,7,0]] matches the pattern of example 6 and 7 where the design of repeated number diagonals and edges gives an output of 1. In test 2: input [[0,8,0],[8,8,8],[0,8,0]] matches exactly example 3 and presumably yields output 6 as the central cross of 8's is a known pattern. In test 3: input [[2,0,2],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]] forms a pattern similar to examples 4 and 5, which were symmetric diagonals of a color with output 2. Thus test 3 yields output 2. Key steps were identifying dominant color patterns, matching shapes formed by the color, then verifying counts of those color blocks to output. The confidence is high given direct pattern matches.",
