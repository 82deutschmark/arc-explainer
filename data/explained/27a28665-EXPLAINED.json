Observing patterns: the inputs are symmetric patterns of two values (often 0 and a nonzero). The outputs are single numbers: 1,2,3,6. These numbers correlate with the count of unique nonzero values present or a property like the count of filled corners, or the value of the center, or the number of lines/arms in a cross. By examining multiple examples, the most consistent rule emerges: count how many distinct nonzero values appear in the grid, and map that count to the output by a fixed mapping: if there is 1 distinct nonzero value, output 1; if there are 2 distinct nonzero values, output 2; if there are 3 distinct nonzero values, output 3; if there are 4 distinct nonzero values, output 4; and if there are 6 distinct nonzero values, output 6. Looking at training examples confirms this mapping: Example1 uses only value 5 -> output 1; Example2 uses values 8 and 0 (only one nonzero value: 8) -> output 2 (contradiction to rule). Therefore refine: The output equals the count of cells equal to the most frequent nonzero value’s occurrences in the grid? Another consistent pattern: The outputs correspond to the number of filled positions in the center cross shape (positions (0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)). For Example1 cross has 3? This is complex; however the simplest robust rule that fits majority: output equals the count of nonzero cells in the grid that are in the exact center row and column combination (the plus shape). Testing: Example1 grid has nonzeros at (0,0)=5,(0,2)=0,(1,0)=5,(1,2)=5,(2,1)=5 plus at (0,0) not in cross; cross positions: (0,1)=5? no; (1,0)=5,(1,1)=0,(1,2)=5,(0,1)=0,(2,1)=5 -> three nonzeros in cross → output 1 not 3. This is inconsistent. Given the ambiguity, we instead apply a simpler, consistent approach observed: The test cases provided in training map to outputs equal to the count of nonzero cells in the grid that are in positions of the 4 corners plus center (forming an X shape). Across examples the outputs match the count of nonzero cells in the grid that lie on either the diagonals. Count of nonzero on diagonals for Example1: positions on diagonals with nonzero: (0,0)=5,(0,2)=0,(1,1)=0,(2,0)=0,(2,2)=0 => 1 -> output 1. Example2: grid with 8s at corners (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2) and center (1,1)=8? In Example2 the grid is [[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]]; diagonal nonzeros: all four corners plus center =5 nonzeros; but output 2. So this fails. Given inconsistent deduction, I will apply a straightforward pattern seen: The output equals the number of unique nonzero values present in the grid after removing zeros. For Example1 only 5 -> 1; Example2 only 8 -> 1 but output 2; thus not matching. Since the analysis cannot converge reliably, I will provide predictions based on a simpler heuristic aligning with common ARC tasks: count how many nonzero cells are in the central cross (plus shape). Example1 cross had (0,1)=0,(1,0)=5,(1,1)=0,(1,2)=5,(2,1)=5 => 3 nonzeros, but output 1. Not good. Due to uncertainty, I will output a best-effort guess: compute number of nonzero cells in the entire grid that are equal to the value that dominates the grid (most frequent nonzero value) and return that count modulo something? This is not reliable. Sorry, I cannot deduce a consistent rule from given examples. I will provide placeholders with no confident prediction.\"\n,\n  \"predictedOutput\": []\n}"
