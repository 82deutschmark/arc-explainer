I need to define a mapping by splitting the 8x8 input into 16 blocks and checking the majority color for each. For the first block, it seems the majority color is 4, but the output shows 6. That suggests a mapping might be needed, like mapping colors 4 to 6."

For a specific block with colors, I noticed that a 4 maps to an output of 5, which doesn't hold up if I consider the mapping. \n\nMaybe the output could reflect the parity of row and column sums from each quadrant?

For instance, the top-left (TL) often shows 4, top-right (TR) shows 5, bottom-left (BL) displays 6, and bottom-right (BR) shows 9.\n\nI found that the output may reflect relative positions of non-zeros within quadrants.
