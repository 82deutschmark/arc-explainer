  "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves identifying a pattern in the training examples where certain numbers are replaced with 2s based on their positions relative to other numbers. Specifically, the 5s in the input seem to trigger a transformation in the rows where they appear, leading to the introduction of 2s in specific columns. The pattern is consistent across the training examples, where the presence of 5s leads to a structured placement of 2s in the output grid.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Analyze the first example to see how 5s lead to 2s in specific rows and columns.",
    "Identify that the transformation is not random but follows a specific pattern based on the positions of 5s.",
    "Check the second example for consistency in the placement of 2s relative to 5s and confirm the pattern holds.",
    "Apply the identified pattern to the test case, ensuring to place 2s in the same relative positions as seen in the training examples."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation rule is that whenever a 5 appears in the input grid, it influences the placement of 2s in the output grid, specifically in the same row and certain columns, creating a structured pattern of 2s around the 5s.",
  "hints": [
    "For each 5 in the input, place a 2 in the same row at specific intervals (e.g., every second column).",
    "If a 5 is in column x, then place a 2 in columns x-1, x, and x+1 if they are within bounds.",
