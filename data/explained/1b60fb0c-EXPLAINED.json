In other words, any area of empty space (⬛) that is not connected to the edge of the grid and is surrounded by 'yes' (✅) gets turned into 'alien' (👽).",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the puzzle as a grid of emojis (⬛ and ✅). 2. Find all the empty spaces (⬛) that are not touching the edge of the grid and are completely surrounded by ✅. 3. Change those enclosed ⬛ to 👽. 4. Leave all other tiles the same. (Tip: It might help to think of the grid as numbers, where 0=⬛, 1=✅, 2=👽.)",
      "hints": [

      "patternDescription": "The pattern involves replacing certain '1's in the input with '2's based on their surrounding context. Specifically, if a '1' is surrounded by other '1's, it may become a '2', indicating a stronger presence or importance in that area.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the grid as a whole and identify where the '1's are located. 2. Check the surrounding cells of each '1'. If a '1' has other '1's nearby (especially in a row or column), it may need to be changed to a '2'. 3. Replace the identified '1's with '2's in the output grid. 4. Remember, think of the puzzle in terms of numbers first: '0' is nothing, '1' is something, and '2' is a stronger version of '1'.",

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to convey a message about the importance of community or connection, suggesting that where there are many '1's (agreement or positivity), it is significant enough to be marked as '2' (alien presence). This could indicate a call for unity or collaboration.",

      "patternDescription": "The aliens are transforming certain areas in the emoji map from 'no' (⬛) to 'alien' (👽) in specific parts of the picture. These changes happen in patterns that resemble shapes or symbols, often around the edges or in the middle, creating a kind of 'highlighted' or 'marked' area. Essentially, they are marking some parts of the image with 👽 where there were originally ⬛, following a pattern that outlines or emphasizes certain shapes.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the emojis as numbers: ⬛ is 0, 👽 is 2. Look at the original picture and see where the ⬛ (0) turns into 👽 (2). Notice that the aliens are replacing some of the empty spaces (⬛) with 👽 to form shapes or borders. To understand what they are doing, imagine converting the emojis into numbers, then look for patterns of zeros turning into twos in specific areas—like drawing borders or filling in shapes. Once you see the pattern, you can predict where the aliens will mark next by following the same rule: replace certain ⬛ with 👽 based on the shape or position.",
      "hints": [
        "The aliens are transforming some empty spaces (⬛) into 👽 to create shapes or outlines.",
        "Focus on the areas where ⬛ turns into 👽; these are not random but follow a pattern related to the shape's borders.",
        "Think of the pattern as 'highlighting' or 'marking' parts of the shape with 👽, often around the edges or in specific regions."

This could be a way of showing a symbol, a shape, or a message—like drawing a picture or emphasizing a specific part of the map.

      "patternDescription": "The aliens highlight connected clusters of 'yes/positive' cells (✅) by marking the largest or most central connected group of these cells with 'alien' emojis (👽). Essentially, wherever there is a solid block or shape of ✅s touching each other horizontally or vertically, the aliens 'color in' the core or biggest part of that shape with 👽 to show it’s important or belongs together.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the grid and find all the ✅ (1) cells. 2. Identify groups of ✅ cells that are connected directly up/down/left/right (not diagonally). 3. Among these groups, find the biggest or most central cluster. 4. Replace the cells in that cluster (or the core of it) with 👽 (2). 5. Leave other cells as they are. 6. If you get stuck, switch from thinking about emojis to thinking about the numbers behind them (0,1,2) to spot connected components more easily.",

They could be showing us how to recognize their 'territories' or 'influence zones' inside areas of agreement or activity. This might be a way to distinguish their presence from humans (👤) or neutral zones (⬛), helping us understand where they are active or dominant.",
