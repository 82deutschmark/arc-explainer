  "solvingStrategy": "I analyzed the training examples to identify the transformation pattern. In each case, the input contains 5s in certain positions, and the output replaces some of the 5s with 2s in specific rows. The key insight is that wherever there is a 5 in the last column (column index 9), the same column positions in the rows below (starting from row 3) are replaced with 2s, but only in the columns where the input has a 5 in the first row. The transformation appears to be: for each column j where input[0][j] == 5, and for each row i >= 3 where input[i][9] == 5, set output[i][j] = 2. The first row remains unchanged. The 5s in the last column are preserved. This pattern is consistent across all three training examples. Applying this rule to the test case: the first row has 5s at columns 0, 2, 3, 6, 8. The last column (col 9) has 5s in rows 2, 3, 5, 7, 9. So for each of these rows (2,3,5,7,9), and for each column j where first row has 5 (0,2,3,6,8), we set output[i][j] = 2. All other values remain unchanged.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Step 1: Observe that in all training examples, the first row is unchanged in the output.",
    "Step 2: Identify that the value 5 in the last column (index 9) triggers a transformation in the same row and in the same columns where the first row has 5.",
    "Step 3: In Example 1: first row has 5s at cols 0,3,7; last column has 5s in rows 3 and 7. Output sets rows 3 and 7, cols 0,3,7 to 2.",
    "Step 4: In Example 2: first row has 5s at cols 1,3,4,7; last column has 5s in rows 2,4,7. Output sets rows 2,4,7, cols 1,3,4,7 to 2.",
    "Step 5: In Example 3: first row has 5s at cols 2,3,5,7,8; last column has 5s in rows 2,3,6,8. Output sets rows 2,3,6,8, cols 2,3,5,7,8 to 2.",
    "Step 6: Confirm that only rows with 5 in last column (col 9) are affected, and only columns where first row has 5 are changed to 2.",
    "Step 7: Apply to test case: first row has 5s at cols 0,2,3,6,8. Last column has 5s in rows 2,3,5,7,9.",
    "Step 8: For each of rows 2,3,5,7,9, set output[row][0], output[row][2], output[row][3], output[row][6], output[row][8] = 2.",
    "Step 9: All other values remain as in input.",
    "Step 10: Verify that output matches expected pattern and dimensions."

  "patternDescription": "For each row i where input[i][9] == 5 (last column is 5), and for each column j where input[0][j] == 5 (first row has 5), set output[i][j] = 2. All other cells remain unchanged. The first row is preserved exactly.",
