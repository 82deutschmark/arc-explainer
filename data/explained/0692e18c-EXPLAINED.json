In every example, the 3×3 block that replaces a coloured cell is identical for that task and is independent of the cell’s coordinate.\n3. That block is the logical negation (0↔non-0) of the original 3×3 input pattern:   • positions that were 0 turn into the cell’s colour,   • positions that were coloured turn into 0.  \n4. Cells that are already 0 in the input expand to an all-zero 3×3 block.\n5. Build the mask once from the test input, then tile it (colouring with 3) at every non-zero position; leave zero positions blank.\n6. Assemble the four coloured and five blank blocks into the 9×9 grid.",
