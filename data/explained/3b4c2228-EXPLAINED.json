All training inputs were scanned to confirm: Example2 had one such square → output 100; Examples1 & 4 had two → 110; Example3 had three → 111; Example5 had one → 100.  No other colours influence the result, and overlapping or larger blocks did not appear, so the task reduces to counting distinct exact 2×2 blocks filled with colour 3 and writing that many 1’s on the diagonal.",
