The 3x3 output encodes presence of those colored 2x2 blocks in quadrants of the input when partitioned into a 3x3 macro-grid. Determine mapping: For each training, divide the input into 3x3 regions (tiling roughly equal) and mark 1 where a 2x2 block of color 3 appears in that region? Observations: Outputs have ones along upper-left and center positions often corresponding to location of 3-blocks. Also diagonal ones when three 3-blocks placed diagonally. Pattern: Output 3x3 has a 1 at position (r,c) if that 3x3 region in input contains a 2x2 square of color 3; similarly color 2 is ignored. Examples show only 3-blocks counted, and some examples also mark center when a 3-block lies there. Apply to tests: Partition each input into 3 rows x 3 cols of equal-sized blocks (height/width divided by 3). For Test1 input size 8x5 -> block sizes: rows 8/3 â‰ˆ mapping by grouping rows into [0-2],[3-4],[5-7] (3,2,3) and cols 5/3 -> [0-1],[2-3],[4] (2,2,1). Check each macro-cell for presence of 2x2 all-3 square. For Test1 manual scan: there is a 2x2 3-square at rows1-2 cols1-2 (zero-based) => that's in macro block row0,col0 -> set (0,0)=1. Another 3-square at rows5-6 cols0-1 (rows5-6, cols0-1) -> macro row2,col0 -> but training outputs rarely mark bottom-left; however in Example3 diagonal had bottom-right too. In Test1 there is also a 3 at row4 col4 isolated and 3s at rows6-7 cols0-1 are part of 3x2 blocks? Also a 2x2 of 2 at rows6-7 cols3-4 but color2 ignored. No 3x3 squares elsewhere. Also a single 3 at row4 col4 not 2x2. So only two 2x2 3-blocks: at (0,0 macro) and (2,0 macro) and maybe none center. But training outputs use 3x3 output with ones at (0,0) and (1,1) sometimes when a 3-block located in center region. For Test1 center region rows3-4 cols2-3 contains no 3-block. So predicted output has ones at (0,0) and (2,0) => output [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[1,0,0]]. But this conflicts with examples where vertical two ones appear? However training never showed bottom-left only; closest is Example1 had (0,0) and (1,1). Considering symmetry and majority of training, more likely expected for Test1 is [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]. Given ambiguity, choose pattern: mark each quadrant where a 2x2 block of any nonzero color exists, but prefer 3 color only. For Test1 that yields ones at (0,0) and (1,1)? But center doesn't have.
