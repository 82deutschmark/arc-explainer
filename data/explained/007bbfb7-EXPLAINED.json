      "reasoningLog": "**Decoding block positions**\n\nI'm working on decoding positions for a 9x9 grid using the input matrix A. It seems each 3x3 block in the grid could be the result of some geometric transformation. For instance, Block (0,0) captures the input exactly. Block (0,1) is a zero block, while Block (0,2) again mirrors the input. Interestingly, Block (1,0) reflects the input in the middle left. I’m confirming that each block aligns correctly with the original data. It's fascinating to see how these transformations fit together!\n**Decoding further block positions**\n\nI’m examining the center block (Block (1,1)), which is all zeros. Block (1,2) captures the input again. When checking Block (2,0), I confirm it matches the input. Block (2,1) should also match, but I realize there’s a small error with the columns. It turns out that rows for these blocks do align, but the last block (2,2) is filled with zeros. It’s interesting how the input is reflected with some modifications, and I need to carefully track these patterns across the grid. Each block serves as a puzzle piece!\n**Analyzing the grid structure**\n\nI’m breaking down the last rows and identifying identical patterns. Rows 3, 4, and 5 match with earlier rows. The grid divides into 3 vertical and 3 horizontal blocks. It’s interesting to see how certain blocks, like (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,2), reproduce the input, while others are filled with zeros. The overall pattern suggests the input is placed multiple times across specific blocks, with some positions kept empty. This symmetry in the input seems to be a key part of the transformation system!",

      "patternDescription": "The puzzle takes the original 3x3 grid and uses each of its cells as a guide for a 3x3 mosaic. In the final 9x9 grid, every cell of the original determines one corresponding 3x3 block. If the original cell is nonzero, that block is a copy of the entire input grid; if the original cell is zero, that block is filled entirely with zeros.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the input grid cell by cell. Notice that some cells have a number (here 7) and some are 0. 2. Imagine a 3x3 mosaic where each cell of the input becomes its own block in a larger 9x9 grid (each block is 3x3). 3. For each cell:\n   - If the cell is nonzero (has a 7), fill the corresponding block with a copy of the entire input grid.\n   - If the cell is 0, fill the corresponding block with just zeros.\n4. When you put all the blocks together, you get the final 9x9 grid, which is exactly the provided answer.",
      "hints": [
        "Think of the original grid as a blueprint for a 3x3 arrangement of blocks.",
        "Each block is either a copy of the whole input grid or a block of zeros, depending on whether the corresponding input cell is nonzero or zero.",
        "The positions of 7s and zeros in the original grid directly tell you which blocks to fill with the copy and which to leave as zeros."
