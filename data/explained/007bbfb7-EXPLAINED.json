      "reasoningLog": "First, I need to analyze the training examples to find a pattern. Each input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. That means the output is a larger grid, likely formed by some transformation of the input.\n\nLet me look at Example 1:\n\nInput: [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]\n\nOutput: [[0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7],[0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7],[0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7],[0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7],[7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],[0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7],[0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7],[0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7],[0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7]]\n\nI notice that the output has 9 rows and 9 columns. It seems like the input grid is being used to create a larger grid, perhaps by tiling or some operation.\n\nAnother thing: in the output, there are patterns that look like the input grid is placed in certain positions. Let me see the positions.\n\nI should compare the input and output for each example.\n\nLet me list the inputs and outputs briefly.\n\nExample 1 Input: 3x3 with values 0 and 7.\n\nOutput: 9x9. It looks like the input grid is repeated, but not exactly. There are areas where it's all zeros or something.\n\nPerhaps it's a Kronecker product or something similar, but with a twist.\n\nI recall that in some ARC puzzles, there might be a operation where each cell in the input is replaced by a 3x3 block based on its value or position.\n\nBut let's see the values. In Example 1, input has 0 and 7. Output has 0 and 7.\n\nSimilarly, Example 2: Input [[4,0,4],[0,0,0],[0,4,0]] → Output has 4 and 0.\n\nExample 3: Input [[0,0,0],[0,0,2],[2,0,2]] → Output has 0 and 2.\n\nExample 4: Input [[6,6,0],[6,0,0],[0,6,6]] → Output has 6 and 0.\n\nExample 5: Input [[2,2,2],[0,0,0],[0,2,2]] → Output has 2 and 0.\n\nSo the values are preserved, but the grid is expanded.\n\nNow, looking at the output grids, they seem to be composed of 3x3 blocks. Since the output is 9x9, it could be that each cell in the input corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output.\n\nBut the output blocks aren't just copies of the input; they seem to be transformed.\n\nLet me take Example 1.\n\nInput cell (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 7, (1,3) is 7, etc.\n\nIn the output, if I divide it into 3x3 blocks, there are 9 blocks (since 9/3=3, so 3 blocks per row and column).\n\nLet's list the output rows for Example 1:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7] → so columns 1-3: [0,0,0], columns 4-6: [0,7,7], columns 7-9: [0,7,7]\n\nSimilarly, row 2: [0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7] → cols 1-3: [0,0,0], cols 4-6: [7,7,7], cols 7-9: [7,7,7]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7] → cols 1-3: [0,0,0], cols 4-6: [0,7,7], cols 7-9: [0,7,7]\n\nRow 4: [0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7] → cols 1-3: [0,7,7], cols 4-6: [0,7,7], cols 7-9: [0,7,7]\n\nRow 5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7] → cols 1-3: [7,7,7], cols 4-6: [7,7,7], cols 7-9: [7,7,7]\n\nRow 6: [0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7] → cols 1-3: [0,7,7], cols 4-6: [0,7,7], cols 7-9: [0,7,7]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7] → similar to row 1\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7] → similar to row 2\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7] → similar to row 3\n\nNow, the input is [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]\n\nIf I consider the output as 3x3 blocks, each block is 3x3.\n\nThe blocks seem to be related to the input values.\n\nNotice that in the output, the blocks are not all the same. For example, the block at position (1,1) in output blocks is [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] from rows 1-3, cols 1-3: which is all zeros.\n\nSimilarly, block (1,2) is rows 1-3, cols 4-6: [0,7,7; 7,7,7; 0,7,7] which is exactly the input grid? Let's see: input is [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]] so yes, that's the input.\n\nBlock (1,3) is rows 1-3, cols 7-9: [0,7,7; 7,7,7; 0,7,7] again the input? No, from above: cols 7-9 for row 1: 0,7,7; row 2: 7,7,7; row 3: 0,7,7 — yes, same as input.\n\nBut input has [0,7,7] for row 1, which matches.\n\nNow block (2,1): rows 4-6, cols 1-3: from row 4: [0,7,7], row 5: [7,7,7], row 6: [0,7,7] — again the input grid.\n\nBlock (2,2): rows 4-6, cols 4-6: from row 4 cols 4-6: [0,7,7], row 5: [7,7,7], row 6: [0,7,7] — input grid.\n\nBlock (2,3): same, input grid.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the output has different values in some places. From above, for example, row 4 cols 1-3 is [0,7,7], which is input row 1, but input row 1 is [0,7,7], so it matches, but in the output, there are blocks that are all zeros or something.\n\nLet's list all blocks for Example 1.\n\nDefine the output grid as 3x3 blocks, each 3x3.\n\nBlock (i,j) where i=1,2,3 for row block, j=1,2,3 for column block.\n\nFrom output rows:\n\nBlock (1,1): rows 1-3, cols 1-3: [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0] — all zeros\n\nBlock (1,2): rows 1-3, cols 4-6: [0,7,7], [7,7,7], [0,7,7] — which is the input grid\n\nBlock (1,3): rows 1-3, cols 7-9: [0,7,7], [7,7,7], [0,7,7] — input grid\n\nBlock (2,1): rows 4-6, cols 1-3: [0,7,7], [7,7,7], [0,7,7] — input grid\n\nBlock (2,2): rows 4-6, cols 4-6: [7,7,7], [7,7,7], [7,7,7]? No, from row 4: cols 4-6 are 0,7,7? Let's see row 4: [0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7] so cols 4-6 are the fourth, fifth, sixth elements: after first three, so index 4,5,6: which are 0,7,7? Let's list indices properly.\n\nIn programming terms, indices start from 0, but for clarity, let's use 1-based for now.\n\nRow 4: values at position 1:0, 2:7, 3:7, 4:0, 5:7, 6:7, 7:0, 8:7, 9:7\n\nSo cols 4-6: values at col4,5,6: which are 0,7,7\n\nSimilarly, row 5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7] so cols 4-6: 7,7,7\n\nRow 6: [0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7] so cols 4-6: 0,7,7\n\nSo for block (2,2): rows 4-6, cols 4-6: row4 cols4-6: 0,7,7; row5 cols4-6: 7,7,7; row6 cols4-6: 0,7,7 — which is the input grid? Input is [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]] so yes, it is the input grid.\n\nSimilarly, block (2,3): rows 4-6, cols 7-9: row4 cols7-9: 0,7,7; row5 cols7-9: 7,7,7; row6 cols7-9: 0,7,7 — input grid.\n\nBlock (3,1): rows 7-9, cols 1-3: from row7: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7] so cols1-3: 0,0,0; row8: [0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7] cols1-3: 0,0,0; row9: [0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7] cols1-3: 0,0,0 — all zeros.\n\nBlock (3,2): rows 7-9, cols 4-6: row7 cols4-6: 0,7,7; row8 cols4-6: 7,7,7; row9 cols4-6: 0,7,7 — input grid.\n\nBlock (3,3): rows 7-9, cols 7-9: row7 cols7-9: 0,7,7; row8 cols7-9: 7,7,7; row9 cols7-9: 0,7,7 — input grid.\n\nSo in Example 1, the output has the input grid in most blocks, but blocks (1,1) and (3,1) are all zeros? Block (1,1) is all zeros, block (3,1) is all zeros, but what about block (2,1)? It was input grid.\n\nBlock (1,1) all zeros, block (1,2) input, block (1,3) input, block (2,1) input, block (2,2) input, block (2,3) input, block (3,1) all zeros, block (3,2) input, block (3,3) input.\n\nBut in the output, there are also other values, but from above, the blocks are either all zeros or the input grid.\n\nBut in the output, for example, row 4 cols 1-3 is [0,7,7] which is input, so block (2,1) is input, not all zeros.\n\nBut why are some blocks all zeros? In this case, blocks (1,1) and (3,1) are all zeros.\n\nNow, what determines which blocks are all zeros? It must be related to the input values or positions.\n\nLet's look at the input grid. Input has value 0 at position (1,1) and (3,1), i.e., top-left and bottom-left are 0.\n\nIn the output, the blocks that are all zeros correspond to the positions where the input has 0? But in input, (1,1) is 0, and output block (1,1) is zeros, similarly input (3,1) is 0, output block (3,1) is zeros.\n\nBut input (2,1) is 7, which is not 0, and output block (2,1) is input grid, not zeros.\n\nBut output block (1,1) is zeros, which corresponds to input cell (1,1) value 0.\n\nSimilarly, output block (3,1) is zeros, corresponds to input cell (3,1) value 0.\n\nBut what about other blocks? For example, output block (1,2) is input grid, which corresponds to input cell (1,2) value 7, which is not 0.\n\nOutput block (1,3) is input grid, corresponds to input cell (1,3) value 7.\n\nOutput block (2,1) is input grid, corresponds to input cell (2,1) value 7.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input, it seems that in the output, the corresponding 3x3 block is either all zeros if the input cell is 0, or it is the input grid itself if the input cell is non-zero.\n\nIn Example 1, input cell (1,1) is 0, so output block (1,1) is zeros.\n\nInput cell (1,2) is 7, so output block (1,2) is input grid.\n\nSimilarly, input cell (1,3) is 7, output block (1,3) is input grid.\n\nInput cell (2,1) is 7, output block (2,1) is input grid.\n\nInput cell (2,2) is 7, output block (2,2) is input grid.\n\nInput cell (2,3) is 7, output block (2,3) is input grid.\n\nInput cell (3,1) is 0, output block (3,1) is zeros.\n\nInput cell (3,2) is 7, output block (3,2) is input grid.\n\nInput cell (3,3) is 7, output block (3,3) is input grid.\n\nAnd indeed, from the output, we see that.\n\nBut in the output, the blocks are placed in a 3x3 arrangement, so for each input cell (i,j), the output block at position (i,j) is either zeros or the input grid.\n\nNow, let's verify with other examples.\n\nTake Example 2:\n\nInput: [[4,0,4],[0,0,0],[0,4,0]]\n\nSo input cells: (1,1)=4, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=4, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=4, (3,3)=0\n\nNow, output should have for each input cell, if value is 0, output block is all zeros, else output block is input grid.\n\nBut input grid has values 4 and 0, so for non-zero, output block should be the input grid which has 4 and 0.\n\nNow look at output: [[4,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,4],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0]]\n\nNow, divide into 3x3 blocks.\n\nBlock (1,1): rows 1-3, cols 1-3: [4,0,4], [0,0,0], [0,4,0] — which is the input grid? Input is [[4,0,4],[0,0,0],[0,4,0]], so yes.\n\nBut according to my theory, since input cell (1,1)=4 which is non-zero, output block (1,1) should be input grid, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, input cell (1,2)=0, so output block (1,2) should be all zeros.\n\nOutput block (1,2): rows 1-3, cols 4-6: from row1: after first three, values at col4,5,6: from output row1: [4,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,4] so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0\n\nRow2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0\n\nRow3: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0 — so all zeros, good.\n\nInput cell (1,3)=4, non-zero, so output block (1,3) should be input grid.\n\nOutput block (1,3): rows 1-3, cols 7-9: row1 cols7-9: 4,0,4? Row1: values at index 7,8,9: 4,0,4 — but input grid has row1: 4,0,4, so yes.\n\nRow2 cols7-9: from row2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] so 0,0,0 — input has row2: 0,0,0, good.\n\nRow3 cols7-9: from row3: [0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0] so cols7,8,9: 0,4,0 — input has row3: 0,4,0, good.\n\nNow input cell (2,1)=0, so output block (2,1) should be all zeros.\n\nOutput block (2,1): rows 4-6, cols 1-3: from output row4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] so cols1-3: 0,0,0\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] cols1-3: 0,0,0\n\nRow6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] cols1-3: 0,0,0 — all zeros, good.\n\nSimilarly, input cell (2,2)=0, so output block (2,2) should be all zeros.\n\nOutput block (2,2): rows 4-6, cols 4-6: all zeros from rows 4,5,6.\n\nInput cell (2,3)=0, so output block (2,3) all zeros.\n\nNow input cell (3,1)=0, so output block (3,1) all zeros.\n\nOutput block (3,1): rows 7-9, cols 1-3: from row7: [0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0] so cols1-3: 0,0,0\n\nRow8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] cols1-3: 0,0,0\n\nRow9: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] cols1-3: 0,0,0 — all zeros, good.\n\nInput cell (3,2)=4, non-zero, so output block (3,2) should be input grid.\n\nOutput block (3,2): rows 7-9, cols 4-6: row7 cols4-6: 4,0,4? Row7: [0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0] so cols4,5,6: 4,0,4 — which is input row1? But we need the whole input grid.\n\nOutput block should be the input grid, which is 3x3.\n\nSo for block (3,2): rows 7-9, cols 4-6: from row7: values at col4,5,6: 4,0,4\n\nRow8: values at col4,5,6: from row8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] so 0,0,0\n\nRow9: values at col4,5,6: from row9: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] so 0,4,0? Col4,5,6: after first three, so index 4,5,6: 0,4,0? Let's see row9: values: pos1:0, pos2:0, pos3:0, pos4:0, pos5:4, pos6:0, pos7:0, pos8:0, pos9:0? From output: [0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0] so yes, col4:0, col5:4, col6:0\n\nSo rows 7-9, cols 4-6: row7: 4,0,4; row8: 0,0,0; row9: 0,4,0 — which is exactly the input grid: [[4,0,4],[0,0,0],[0,4,0]], perfect.\n\nSimilarly, input cell (3,3)=0, so output block (3,3) should be all zeros.\n\nOutput block (3,3): rows 7-9, cols 7-9: row7 cols7-9: 0,0,0; row8 cols7-9: 0,0,0; row9 cols7-9: 0,0,0 — all zeros, good.\n\nSo Example 2 confirms the pattern: for each input cell (i,j), the output block at (i,j) is a 3x3 grid that is all zeros if input[i][j] == 0, otherwise it is the entire input grid.\n\nNow check Example 3.\n\nInput: [[0,0,0],[0,0,2],[2,0,2]]\n\nSo input has values 0 and 2.\n\nNow, output should be: for each input cell, if value is 0, output block is zeros, else output block is input grid.\n\nInput cells: (1,1)=0, so output block (1,1) zeros\n\n(1,2)=0, output block (1,2) zeros\n\n(1,3)=0, output block (1,3) zeros\n\n(2,1)=0, output block (2,1) zeros\n\n(2,2)=0, output block (2,2) zeros\n\n(2,3)=2, output block (2,3) input grid\n\n(3,1)=2, output block (3,1) input grid\n\n(3,2)=0, output block (3,2) zeros\n\n(3,3)=2, output block (3,3) input grid\n\nNow, the output grid is 9x9, so let's see if it matches.\n\nFrom the given output: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2],[2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2]]\n\nNow, block (1,1): rows 1-3, cols 1-3: from row1: all 0, row2: all 0, row3: all 0 — zeros, good.\n\nBlock (1,2): rows 1-3, cols 4-6: similarly, all zeros from rows 1-3, cols 4-6 should be zeros? From output, row1 cols4-6: 0,0,0 (since row1 all 0), similarly row2, row3 all 0, so zeros, good.\n\nBlock (1,3): rows 1-3, cols 7-9: all zeros, good.\n\nBlock (2,1): rows 4-6, cols 1-3: from row4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] so cols1-3: 0,0,0; row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] so cols1-3: 0,0,0; row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2] so cols1-3: 0,0,0 — all zeros, good.\n\nBlock (2,2): rows 4-6, cols 4-6: should be zeros. row4 cols4-6: 0,0,0; row5 cols4-6: from row5: values at col4,5,6: after first three, so indices 4,5,6: 0,0,0? row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] so positions: 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:2 so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0 similarly row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2] so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0 — all zeros, good.\n\nBlock (2,3): rows 4-6, cols 7-9: should be input grid since input (2,3)=2.\n\nInput grid is [[0,0,0],[0,0,2],[2,0,2]]\n\nSo output block (2,3): rows 4-6, cols 7-9.\n\nrow4 cols7-9: from row4: all 0, so 0,0,0 — but input row1 is [0,0,0], good.\n\nrow5 cols7-9: from row5: values at col7,8,9: 0,0,2? row5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2] so col7:0, col8:0, col9:2 — but input row2 is [0,0,2], so col7:0, col8:0, col9:2? input row2 has three values: 0,0,2 so yes, col7:0, col8:0, col9:2? But in terms of order, it should be the values, so for row5, cols7,8,9 are 0,0,2 which matches input row2: 0,0,2.\n\nBut input row2 is the second row, which is [0,0,2], so when we place the input grid, it should be row by row.\n\nSimilarly, row6 cols7-9: from row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2] so col7:2, col8:0, col9:2 — and input row3 is [2,0,2], so yes, matches.\n\nSo block (2,3) is input grid.\n\nNow block (3,1): rows 7-9, cols 1-3: should be input grid since input (3,1)=2.\n\nInput grid: [[0,0,0],[0,0,2],[2,0,2]]\n\nSo output block (3,1): rows 7-9, cols 1-3.\n\nFrom output: row7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] so cols1-3: 0,0,0 — input row1: 0,0,0, good.\n\nrow8: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2] so cols1-3: 0,0,2 — input row2: 0,0,2, good.\n\nrow9: [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2] so cols1-3: 2,0,2 — input row3: 2,0,2, good.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBlock (3,2): rows 7-9, cols 4-6: should be zeros since input (3,2)=0.\n\nFrom output, row7 cols4-6: 0,0,0; row8 cols4-6: from row8: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2] so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0; row9 cols4-6: from row9: [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2] so cols4,5,6: 0,0,0 — all zeros, good.\n\nBlock (3,3): rows 7-9, cols 7-9: should be input grid since input (3,3)=2.\n\nInput grid: [[0,0,0],[0,0,2],[2,0,2]]\n\nOutput: row7 cols7-9: 0,0,0 — input row1, good.\n\nrow8 cols7-9: from row8: values at col7,8,9: 0,0,2? row8: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2] so col7:0, col8:0, col9:2 — input row2: 0,0,2, good.\n\nrow9 cols7-9: from row9: [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,2] so col7:2, col8:0, col9:2 — input row3: 2,0,2, good.\n\nSo all matches.\n\nNow Example 4 and 5 should similarly hold.\n\nSo the pattern is clear: for a given input grid I of size 3x3, the output grid O of size 9x9 is constructed by dividing O into 3x3 blocks, each of size 3x3. For each block position (i,j) in O, corresponding to input cell I[i][j], the block is set to a 3x3 grid of all zeros if I[i][j] == 0, otherwise it is set to the entire input grid I.\n\nNow for the test case.\n\nTest case input: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nSo input has values 7 and 0.\n\nWe need to compute the output for each block.\n\nFirst, list the input cells:\n\nI[1][1] = 7 (non-zero)\n\nI[1][2] = 0\n\nI[1][3] = 7\n\nI[2][1] = 7\n\nI[2][2] = 0\n\nI[2][3] = 7\n\nI[3][1] = 7\n\nI[3][2] = 7\n\nI[3][3] = 0\n\nNow, for each, output block:\n\nSince output is 9x9, with 3x3 blocks.\n\nBlock (1,1): since I[1][1] = 7 ≠ 0, so set to input grid: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nBlock (1,2): since I[1][2] = 0, so set to all zeros: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nBlock (1,3): since I[1][3] = 7 ≠ 0, so set to input grid: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nBlock (2,1): since I[2][1] = 7 ≠ 0, so set to input grid: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nBlock (2,2): since I[2][2] = 0, so set to all zeros: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nBlock (2,3): since I[2][3] = 7 ≠ 0, so set to input grid: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nBlock (3,1): since I[3][1] = 7 ≠ 0, so set to input grid: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nBlock (3,2): since I[3][2] = 7 ≠ 0, so set to input grid: [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]\n\nBlock (3,3): since I[3][3] = 0, so set to all zeros: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nNow, we need to combine these blocks into a 9x9 grid.\n\nThe output grid O is arranged such that block (i,j) is placed at rows (3*(i-1)+1 to 3*i) and columns (3*(j-1)+1 to 3*j) for i,j from 1 to 3.\n\nIn terms of indices, let's define the rows and columns.\n\nFor block (1,1): rows 1-3, cols 1-3\n\nBlock (1,2): rows 1-3, cols 4-6\n\nBlock (1,3): rows",
