      "patternDescription": "The aliens are applying a border pattern: they fill the outer edges of the grid with a symbol (♥), and inside the grid, they leave the original pattern unchanged (all zeros). Essentially, they create a frame around the original pattern, turning the border into symbols and leaving the inside intact.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the emojis as numbers: the entire grid gets its outermost cells changed to ♥ (which is 8), and the inner cells stay the same (zeros). To solve similar puzzles, imagine wrapping the original pattern with a border of ♥ symbols, like adding a frame around a picture. For humans, this means taking the original grid, replacing all the outermost cells with ♥, and keeping the inner cells as they are. The key is to focus on the outer edge of the grid and change just those cells.",
      "hints": [
        "The pattern involves changing only the border of the grid.",
        "Inner cells remain the same, only the outside gets transformed.",
        "Think of it as adding a frame or border around the existing pattern."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to show friendship and peace by placing a 'border' of good symbols (♥) around the pattern, perhaps indicating a protective or welcoming gesture. They might be communicating that they see us as part of a larger 'frame' of understanding or community, not as enemies.",
