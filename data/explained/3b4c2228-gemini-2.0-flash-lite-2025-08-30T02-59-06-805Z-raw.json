  "solvingStrategy": "The pattern involves identifying the largest connected regions of color 3 in the input grid and mapping them to the output grid. The output grid has a 3x3 structure. Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a region of color 3 in the input. If a region exists, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 1; otherwise, it's 0. The position of the 1 in the output grid is determined by the relative position of the color 3 regions in the input. The first region maps to [0,0], the second to [1,0], the third to [2,0], and so on. The color 2 regions are ignored.",
  "keySteps": [
    "1. Analyze training examples: Observe the relationship between input and output grids. The output grids are consistently 3x3.",
    "2. Identify color 3 regions: Focus on the connected regions of color 3 in the input.",
    "3. Map regions to output: Determine the position of the '1' in the output grid based on the location of the color 3 regions.",
    "4. Apply to test case 1: Identify color 3 regions and map them to the output grid.",

The position of the '1' in the output grid is determined by the relative position of the color 3 regions in the input.",
  "hints": [
    "Algorithm 1 (Best): Iterate through the input grid. For each cell with value 3, perform a flood fill to identify the connected region. Count the number of regions. Create a 3x3 output grid. Set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 1 for each region found.  Pseudo-code: `for each cell in input: if cell == 3 and not visited: flood_fill(cell); count++; output[region_index] = 1`",
    "Algorithm 2 (Math): Calculate the bounding box of each color 3 region. Determine the relative positions of these bounding boxes. Map the bounding box positions to the output grid. Pseudo-code: `for each region: calculate bounding_box; determine position in output grid; output[position] = 1`",
    "Algorithm 3 (Emojis): 🔍 Input grid -> 🧱 Color 3 regions -> 🗺️ Map to 3x3 output -> ✅ Set 1s in output grid. Pseudo-code: `Input -> Find 3s -> Group 3s -> Create 3x3 -> Place 1s`"
