      "solvingStrategy": "The transformation involves identifying isolated non-zero cells (objects) in the input grid, each defined by its row r, column c, and color k. The grid has height h (number of rows) and width w (number of columns). Objects are processed in order from top to bottom (increasing row index).\n\nFor each object:\n1. Fill the horizontal line in row r from column c to column w-1 with color k.\n2. Fill the vertical line in column w-1 starting from row r+1 downward to (but not including) the row of the next object, or to the last row if it is the last object.\n\nThis rule is applied independently for each object, filling the gaps between them with vertical extensions in the rightmost column. The rest of the grid remains 0.\n\nFor the test input:\n- Grid: 7 rows (0-6), 8 columns (0-7)\n- Objects: (r=0, c=3, k=8), (r=2, c=2, k=7), (r=4, c=5, k=2)\n\nProcessing:\n- First (r=0, k=8): Horizontal row 0, cols 3-7 with 8. Vertical: rows 1 to before 2 (only row 1), col 7 with 8.\n- Second (r=2, k=7): Horizontal row 2, cols 2-7 with 7. Vertical: rows 3 to before 4 (only row 3), col 7 with 7.\n- Third (r=4, k=2): Horizontal row 4, cols 5-7 with 2. Vertical: rows 5 to 6, col 7 with 2.",
