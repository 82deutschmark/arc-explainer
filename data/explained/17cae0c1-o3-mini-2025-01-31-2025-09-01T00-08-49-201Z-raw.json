  "solvingStrategy": "We observed that each training input is a 3x9 grid that can be split vertically into three 3x3 blocks. In each block the cells with value 5 form a pattern which is then replaced by a constant output digit in a uniformly filled 3x3 output block. By comparing training examples, we identified five distinct patterns: a block with only the top row filled with 5's (mapped to 6), only the bottom row filled (mapped to 1), a center dot only (mapped to 4), a diagonal pattern (cells at top-right, center, and bottom-left filled, mapped to 9), and a full border (all cells except the center are 5, mapped to 3). We then partitioned the test input into three 3x3 blocks, recognized the pattern in each, and assigned the corresponding output digit. Block1 has only its bottom row filled with 5's (mapping to 1), Block2 shows the diagonal pattern (mapping to 9), and Block3 has only its top row filled with 5's (mapping to 6). Finally, each output block is expanded to a uniform 3x3 subgrid in the output.",

    "Apply this mapping to the test input: Block1 (bottom row filled) becomes 1, Block2 (diagonal) becomes 9, and Block3 (top row filled) becomes 6.",
    "Construct the final output grid by replacing each 3x3 block with a uniform block of the computed digit."

  "patternDescription": "The puzzle partitions the input into three vertical 3x3 blocks and recognizes specific patterns of 5's in each block. These patterns correspond to five different digits: a full border (all cells except center are 5) gives 3, center-only gives 4, diagonal (top-right, center, bottom-left) gives 9, top row only gives 6, and bottom row only gives 1. The output grid is then formed by filling each block uniformly with its assigned digit.",
  "hints": [
    "if block[0]=[all 0], block[1]=[only bottom row 5's] then output=1; else if block[0]=[diagonal 5's] then output=9; else if block[0]=[top row 5's] then output=6",
    "Divide grid into three 3x3; for each subgrid, use: bottomRowFull -> 1, diagonal (cell positions (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)) -> 9, topRowFull -> 6.",
