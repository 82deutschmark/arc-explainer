  "solvingStrategy": "The pattern involves grouping consecutive identical numbers in the input and mapping them to a new number in the output. The mapping appears to be based on the original number and its position within the input grid. The input grid is treated as a 1D array of 9 elements. The transformation is applied to each row independently. The core logic is to identify consecutive identical numbers and assign a unique output value based on the original input value and its position in the row.",
  "keySteps": [
    "1. Analyze Example 1: Input has 5s, 0s. Output has 3s, 4s, 9s. The 5s are mapped to 3, 4, 9 based on their position. 0s are mapped to 4. The pattern is applied row-wise.",
    "2. Analyze Example 2: Input has 5s, 0s. Output has 9s, 1s, 4s. The 5s are mapped to 9, 1, 4 based on their position. 0s are mapped to 1, 4, 9.",
    "3. Analyze Example 3: Input has 5s, 0s. Output has 6s, 3s, 1s. The 5s are mapped to 6, 3, 1 based on their position. 0s are mapped to 6, 3, 1.",
    "4. Analyze Example 4: Input has 5s, 0s. Output has 4s, 6s, 3s. The 5s are mapped to 4, 6, 3 based on their position. 0s are mapped to 4, 6, 3.",
    "5. Identify the mapping rule: The mapping is based on the original number and its position within the row. Consecutive identical numbers are grouped and assigned a unique output value. The 0s are mapped to a different value than the 5s.",
    "6. Apply the pattern to the test case: The input has 0s and 5s. The 5s are mapped to 6, 1, 6 based on their position. The 0s are mapped to 1.",
    "7. Construct the output grid based on the identified mapping."
  ],
  "patternDescription": "The transformation involves grouping consecutive identical numbers in each row of the input grid and mapping them to new numbers in the output grid. The mapping depends on the original number and its position within the row. The 0s and 5s are mapped to different values. The mapping is applied row-wise.",
  "hints": [
    "1. Best Approach (Pseudo-code): For each row, iterate through the input. Group consecutive identical numbers. Assign a unique output value based on the original number and its position within the row. For example, if the input is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5], the output would be [x,x,x,y,y,y,y,y,z]. The values of x, y, and z are determined by the position and original value.",
    "2. Math Approach: Define a mapping function f(value, position) -> output_value. For each row, apply f to each element. The function f would use a lookup table or conditional logic to determine the output value based on the input value and its position. For example, if the input is [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5], the output would be f(5,0), f(5,1), f(5,2), f(0,3), f(0,4), f(0,5), f(0,6), f(0,7), f(5,8).",
    "3. Emojis Approach: ‚û°Ô∏è Iterate through each row. üëØ Group consecutive identical numbers. üó∫Ô∏è Map each group to a new value based on the original number and position. üîÑ Repeat for each row. For example, [5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,5] becomes [x,x,x,y,y,y,y,y,z]."
