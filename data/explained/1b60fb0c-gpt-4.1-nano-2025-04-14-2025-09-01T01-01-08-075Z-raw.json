The transformation appears to extend the pattern of the central shape, filling in gaps and emphasizing the main structure, especially around the middle rows and columns. The pattern is consistent with previous examples where the main shape is highlighted with a different value, often 2, to emphasize the structure.",

    "Note the use of a new value (2) to highlight or extend the shape.",
    "Apply similar transformation rules to the test input, emphasizing the main shape and filling gaps with 2.",
