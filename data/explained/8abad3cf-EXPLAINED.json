      "reasoningLog": "We are given three examples: two training examples and one test case.\n The numbers map to emojis as provided.\n\n Let's first look at the training examples to understand the pattern.\n\n Example 1:\n Input: \n [[4,4,4,4,4,7,7],\n  [4,7,7,7,4,7,5],\n  [4,7,1,7,4,7,5],\n  [4,7,7,7,4,7,7],\n  [4,4,4,4,4,7,5],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,7,5],\n  [5,5,5,5,5,7,7]]\n\n Output:\n [[7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4],\n  [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4],\n  [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4],\n  [1,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4]]\n\n Example 2:\n Input:\n [[9,9,9,9],\n  [7,7,9,7],\n  [9,9,9,9],\n  [7,7,7,7],\n  [7,6,7,6],\n  [7,6,7,6],\n  [7,7,7,7]]\n\n Output:\n [[7,7,7,9,9,9],\n  [6,6,7,9,9,9],\n  [6,6,7,9,9,9]]\n\n Now, the test case:\n Input:\n [[7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4],\n  [0,0,7,0,7,0,7,9,7,4],\n  [0,0,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,4],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7]]\n\n Correct Answer:\n [[7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [7,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [9,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0]]\n\n We note that the input and output grids are of different dimensions.\n\n Observing the training examples:\n\n In Example 1:\n Input: 7 rows, 7 columns\n Output: 4 rows, 10 columns\n\n How did we get from input to output?\n Notice that the output grid has 4 rows and 10 columns. The input has 7 rows and 7 columns.\n\n Let's compare the content:\n\n Input row 0: [4,4,4,4,4,7,7] -> Output row 0: [7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4]\n Input row 1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> Output row 1: [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4]\n Input row 2: [4,7,1,7,4,7,5] -> Output row 2: [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4]   [but note the output row 3 has a 1?]\n Input row 3: [4,7,7,7,4,7,7]\n Input row 4: [4,4,4,4,4,7,5]\n Input row 5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,5]\n Input row 6: [5,5,5,5,5,7,7]\n\n Output:\n Row0: [7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4] -> notice the last 4 elements are 4,4,4,4 which match the first 4 of the first row of input? Not exactly.\n\n Alternatively, let's try to see if the output is built from parts of the input.\n\n Notice that the output has 4 rows. The input has 7 rows. Maybe we are taking every other row? Or perhaps we are grouping.\n\n Another idea: maybe we are extracting a specific region.\n\n Looking at the output, we see:\n - The first 5 elements of row0: [7,7,7,7,7] and then [7] then [4,4,4,4]. \n - Row1: [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4]\n\n Also, the last row of output has a 1, which appears in the input at row2, column2.\n\n How about we look at the input and see if there's a pattern of boundaries?\n\n Notice in the input, the number 4 forms a frame? The first 5 rows start with 4 and the last column has 7 or 5? It's messy.\n\n Alternatively, let's look at the differences between the input and output.\n\n In Example 2:\n\n Input: 7 rows, 4 columns\n Output: 3 rows, 6 columns\n\n Input:\n [9,9,9,9]\n [7,7,9,7]\n [9,9,9,9]\n [7,7,7,7]\n [7,6,7,6]\n [7,6,7,6]\n [7,7,7,7]\n\n Output:\n [7,7,7,9,9,9]\n [6,6,7,9,9,9]\n [6,6,7,9,9,9]\n\n How is this output generated?\n The output has:\n Row0: [7,7,7,9,9,9] -> the first three 7s? The input has 7s in row1 (first two and last) but not three in a row? \n Row1 and Row2: [6,6,7,9,9,9] and same.\n\n Notice that the output has the last three columns as 9,9,9. That matches the first row of input? But the first row of input is [9,9,9,9] and we have three 9s.\n\n Also, the first three columns: row0: 7,7,7 -> that might come from the row4? row4 is [7,6,7,6] -> not three 7s.\n\n Another idea: perhaps we are taking the last three rows of input? But the last three rows of input are:\n [7,7,7,7]\n [7,6,7,6]\n [7,6,7,6]\n [7,7,7,7] -> actually 4 rows? The input has 7 rows, so rows 4,5,6? But the output has 3 rows.\n\n Let me index the input rows from 0 to 6.\n\n Row3: [7,7,7,7]\n Row4: [7,6,7,6]\n Row5: [7,6,7,6]\n Row6: [7,7,7,7]\n\n Now the output:\n Row0: [7,7,7,9,9,9] -> first three: 7,7,7 -> that matches row3? row3 is [7,7,7,7] -> first three are 7,7,7. Then we add 9,9,9? Where do 9s come from? The first row of input? [9,9,9,9] -> first three 9s? But we are taking the last three of the row? No, we are taking the first three of row0? Then we take the first three of row0 of input? But row0 is [9,9,9,9] -> first three 9s.\n\n So for output row0: first three from row3? and last three from row0? But row3 has 4 columns, we take first three? And row0 has 4, we take first three? Then we get [7,7,7] and [9,9,9] -> [7,7,7,9,9,9]. That matches.\n\n Now row1 of output: [6,6,7,9,9,9] -> first three: 6,6,7? \n Row4 of input: [7,6,7,6] -> if we take the entire row? But we have 4 elements. We need to take three? But the output has 6,6,7. How about we take the last three of row4? [6,7,6] -> that doesn't match [6,6,7]. Alternatively, take row4 and then row0 again? But we already used row0? \n\n Alternatively, for each row in the output, we take a part from a specific row in the input? But we used row3 and row0 for row0 of output? Then for row1 of output, we take row4? Row4: [7,6,7,6] -> if we take the last three? [6,7,6] -> but we want 6,6,7? Not matching.\n\n How about we take from row5? Row5: [7,6,7,6] -> same as row4. \n\n Notice the output row1 and row2 are the same: [6,6,7,9,9,9]. How do we get 6,6,7? \n\n Looking at row4: [7,6,7,6] -> if we take the second, third, and fourth? [6,7,6] -> still not.\n\n Another idea: maybe we are taking the columns? \n\n In the input, the first column: [9,7,9,7,7,7,7] -> not matching.\n\n How about we split the grid? \n\n Notice that in the input, the first three rows are about 9s and 7s, and the last four rows are about 7s and 6s.\n\n And the output has three rows: \n Row0: [7,7,7,9,9,9] -> the 7s come from the bottom part? The 9s from the top?\n Row1: [6,6,7,9,9,9] -> 6s from the bottom, 7 and 9s?\n Row2: same.\n\n The output rows all end with 9,9,9. That must come from the top rows? Specifically, the first row? \n\n How about each output row is built from two parts: \n - The first part from a row in the bottom part (rows 3 to 6) and the second part from the top row?\n\n Specifically:\n For output row0: \n   First three: from row3? row3 is [7,7,7,7] -> take first three: 7,7,7.\n   Then the next three: from row0? row0 is [9,9,9,9] -> take first three: 9,9,9.\n\n For output row1:\n   First three: from row4? row4: [7,6,7,6] -> but we want 6,6,7? How? \n   If we take the last three of row4: [7,6] -> wait, row4 has only 4 columns. We need three. \n\n Alternatively, we take from row4 but in a different order? \n\n Notice that row4 and row5 are the same? [7,6,7,6]. And row6 is [7,7,7,7].\n\n How about we take the non-7 values? In row4: the non-7 are at positions 1 and 3: 6 and 6. But we need three numbers.\n\n Another idea: the output row1 and row2 are built from row4 and row5? \n\n But we have two output rows and two rows (row4 and row5) in the input? \n\n For row4: [7,6,7,6] -> if we take the 6s? But we have two 6s and we need three numbers? \n\n Wait, the output row1: [6,6,7,9,9,9] -> the 7 is in the middle? \n\n How about we take the entire row from the bottom and then pad? \n\n This is not matching.\n\n Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers. Notice that the output rows all end with 9,9,9. That must be fixed from the top row? \n\n But in the output row0, we have 7,7,7 at the start. In the input, row3 has 7,7,7,7 -> so we took the first three 7s? \n\n For output row1: we have 6,6,7. In the input, row4: [7,6,7,6] -> if we take the last three? [6,7,6] -> which is 6,7,6. But we want 6,6,7. \n\n How about we sort the row? If we sort row4: [6,6,7,7] -> then take the first three? [6,6,7]. That matches! \n\n Similarly, row5: [7,6,7,6] sorted -> [6,6,7,7] -> first three: 6,6,7.\n\n And for row3: [7,7,7,7] sorted is the same -> first three: 7,7,7.\n\n So for each output row, we are taking a row from the input (specifically the last four rows: row3, row4, row5, but row6 is not used? The output has only 3 rows, so row3, row4, row5? But row3 is used for row0, row4 for row1, row5 for row2? But the output row2 is the same as row1? Wait, the output has row0, row1, row2 and they are built from row3, row4, row5? But in the output, row1 and row2 are the same? That doesn't match because row4 and row5 are the same? \n\n In the output, row1 and row2 are both [6,6,7,9,9,9]. So they are identical. So we are using row4 for row1 and row5 for row2? And since row4 and row5 are identical, the output rows are identical? \n\n Then the first part: sort the row and take the first three? For row3: [7,7,7,7] -> sorted [7,7,7,7] -> first three: 7,7,7 -> then append the first three of row0? [9,9,9] -> so [7,7,7,9,9,9]. \n For row4: sort -> [6,6,7,7] -> first three: 6,6,7 -> then append [9,9,9] -> [6,6,7,9,9,9].\n For row5: same as row4 -> [6,6,7,9,9,9].\n\n But the output has only three rows? And we used row3, row4, row5. The input row6 is [7,7,7,7] -> we didn't use it? And the output has three rows? So that matches.\n\n However, the output in Example 1 has 4 rows? And we used row3, row4, row5? But the input has 7 rows? We need to adjust.\n\n Example 1:\n\n Input rows: 0 to 6.\n\n We want to build output from some rows? \n\n Output row0: [7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4] -> 10 elements.\n\n How? \n\n The first part: 7,7,7,7,7,7 -> that's six 7s. The input row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,5] -> first six are 7,7,7,7,7,7? Yes! Then the last four: 4,4,4,4 -> input row0: [4,4,4,4,4,7,7] -> first four are 4,4,4,4? Yes.\n\n Output row1: [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4] -> \n First part: 7,7,5,5,5,7 -> that's 6 elements. \n Input row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> if we take the last six? [7,7,7,4,7,5] -> that doesn't match 7,7,5,5,5,7.\n\n Alternatively, we take from row2: [4,7,1,7,4,7,5] -> last six: [7,1,7,4,7,5] -> not.\n\n How about we sort the row? \n\n Row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> sort: [4,4,5,7,7,7,7] -> then take the last six? [5,7,7,7,7,7] -> but we want 7,7,5,5,5,7? Not matching.\n\n Another idea: we take the row and then pad with the first row? \n\n But the output row1 has 10 elements: 6 from somewhere and 4 from row0? \n\n How about for each row in the output, we take a row from the input and then append the first row? \n\n Output row0: we took row5? row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,5] -> then append row0? [4,4,4,4,4,7,7] -> but that would give 14 elements? We only took the first six of row5 and first four of row0? \n\n Specifically: \n Output row0: first six of row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7] and then first four of row0: [4,4,4,4] -> 10 elements. Matches.\n\n Output row1: we take row1? row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> we need 6 elements? Which six? The first six? [4,7,7,7,4,7] -> then append first four of row0: [4,4,4,4] -> [4,7,7,7,4,7,4,4,4,4] -> but the output is [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4] -> not matching.\n\n Alternatively, take the last six of row1? [7,7,7,4,7,5] -> then append first four of row0: [4,4,4,4] -> [7,7,7,4,7,5,4,4,4,4] -> not [7,7,5,5,5,7,...].\n\n How about we take a sorted version of the row? \n\n Row1 sorted: [4,4,5,7,7,7,7] -> then take the last six: [5,7,7,7,7,7] -> then append first four of row0: [4,4,4,4] -> [5,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4] -> but output row1 starts with 7,7,5 -> not.\n\n Another idea: the output rows are built from two different rows? \n\n Let me try for row1 of output: [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4]\n\n Notice the last four are always 4,4,4,4 from row0.\n\n The first six: 7,7,5,5,5,7 -> that might come from row2? row2: [4,7,1,7,4,7,5] -> if we take the non-4 and non-1? Or sort? \n\n Row2: [4,7,1,7,4,7,5] -> remove the 4s and 1? Then we have [7,7,7,5] -> but we need six numbers? \n\n How about we take the entire row2 but replace the 1 with 5? Because 1 is special? But the output has three 5s.\n\n This is getting messy.\n\n Let me look at the positions of the numbers in the input that appear in the output.\n\n In output row0: first six are 7s -> from row5: first six are 7s? Yes.\n Then four 4s -> from row0: first four are 4s? Yes.\n\n In output row1: first two 7s? Then three 5s? Then a 7? \n In the input, row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> the 7s and 5 are there.\n\n How about we take from row1: the numbers that are not 4? So we get [7,7,7,7,5] -> then we have five numbers, but we need six? \n\n Alternatively, we take the entire row but skip the 4s? That would be [7,7,7,7,5] -> five elements. Not enough.\n\n How about we take the row and then if there is a 4, we replace it with the corresponding number from row0? \n\n But row0 has 4s in the first five positions? \n\n For row1: \n   col0: 4 -> replace with row0[0]=4 -> but we don't want 4? We want to remove 4s? \n\n This is not working.\n\n Let's try a different approach: grid splitting.\n\n In Example 1, the input grid has a border of 4s? The first five rows start with 4, and the first five columns of row0-4 are 4s? Not exactly.\n\n Notice that the output has a common ending: 4,4,4,4 for the first three rows? And the last row has 4,4,4,4 too? \n\n In output row0: ends with 4,4,4,4\n row1: ends with 4,4,4,4\n row2: ends with 4,4,4,4\n row3: ends with 4,4,4,4\n\n So the last four columns are always 4,4,4,4.\n\n The first six columns vary.\n\n How are the first six columns generated?\n\n For row0: 7,7,7,7,7,7 -> from row5: first six are 7,7,7,7,7,7.\n\n For row1: 7,7,5,5,5,7 -> we see in row1: there are 7,7,7,7,5 -> but not in that order.\n\n How about we take the row and then for the first six columns, we take the row from a specific row in the input, but only the non-4 values? But we have to fill six columns.\n\n Another idea: the first six columns of the output are the last six columns of the input row, but then we have to handle the row index.\n\n Let's try:\n\n For output row0: it corresponds to input row5? input row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,5] -> last six: [7,7,7,7,7,5] -> but output has [7,7,7,7,7,7] -> not the same.\n\n First six of row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7] -> matches.\n\n For output row1: it should correspond to input row? Let's say row1: first six: [4,7,7,7,4,7] -> but output wants [7,7,5,5,5,7] -> not matching.\n\n How about we sort the row and then take the last six? \n\n For row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> sort: [4,4,5,7,7,7,7] -> last six: [5,7,7,7,7,7] -> then we have [5,7,7,7,7,7] but output has [7,7,5,5,5,7] -> not sorted order.\n\n Unless we don't sort, but we are to extract in a different way.\n\n In Example 1, the output row1 has three 5s and three 7s? But in the input row1, there is only one 5 and four 7s? \n\n The output row1: [7,7,5,5,5,7] -> has two 7s at the beginning, then three 5s, then a 7.\n\n How is this generated? \n\n Notice that in the input, row2 has a 1. The output row3 has a 1. So perhaps the output row index corresponds to the input row index minus something.\n\n For output row0: from input row5\n output row1: from input row1? \n output row2: from input row2? \n output row3: from input row3? \n\n But output row1 and row2 have the same pattern almost? \n\n Let's try for output row1: take input row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> if we remove the 4s, we get [7,7,7,7,5] -> then if we duplicate the 5 to make three 5s? Why? \n\n This is not clear.\n\n Let's look at the test case to see if we can find a pattern.\n\n Test case input:\n [\n  [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4],\n  [0,0,7,0,7,0,7,9,7,4],\n  [0,0,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,4],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7]\n ]\n\n Correct output:\n [\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [7,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [9,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0]\n ]\n\n We see that the output has 4 rows and 9 columns.\n\n The last five columns of all output rows are: 0,0,0,0 for row0 and row1; for row2 and row3: 0,0,0,0 (last four are 0,0,0,0 but the row has 9 elements, so positions 5 to 8 are 0,0,0,0 and position 9 is not there because it's 9 elements).\n\n Let's count:\n Row0: [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0] -> positions 0-4: 7,7,7,7,7; positions 5-8: 0,0,0,0.\n Similarly, row1: same.\n Row2: [7,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0] -> positions 0-4: 7,7,4,4,7; positions 5-8: 0,0,0,0.\n Row3: [9,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0] -> positions 0-4: 9,7,4,4,7; positions 5-8: 0,0,0,0.\n\n So the last four are always 0,0,0,0.\n\n How about the first five? \n\n For row0: [7,7,7,7,7] -> this might come from row0 of input? row0: [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> the first three are 7,7,7, then 0,0,0. Not five 7s.\n\n row3: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,4] -> first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> matches row0 of output.\n\n For row1 of output: [7,7,7,7,7] -> same as row0. In the input, is there another row with five 7s at the beginning? row4: [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7] -> first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> matches.\n\n So output row0 and row1 are both the first five of row3 and row4 of input? But wait, output row0 and row1 are the same? In the input, row3 and row4 both start with five 7s? \n\n row3: first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> yes.\n row4: first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> yes.\n\n Then for output row2: [7,7,4,4,7] -> this might come from row0? But row0: [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> first five: [7,7,7,0,0] -> not matching.\n\n row1: [0,0,7,0,7,0,7,9,7,4] -> first five: [0,0,7,0,7] -> not.\n\n row2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> first five: [0,0,7,0,0] -> not.\n\n row3: already used.\n row4: already used.\n\n How about the last five of some row? \n\n row0: last five: [0,7,7,7,4] -> not.\n row1: last five: [0,7,9,7,4] -> not.\n row2: last five: [0,7,7,7,4] -> not.\n row3: last five: [7,7,7,0,7,4] -> wait, row3 has 10 elements: positions 5-9: index5=7,6=7,7=0,8=7,9=4 -> [7,7,0,7,4] -> not [7,7,4,4,7].\n\n Another idea: perhaps we are taking a vertical strip? \n\n In the input, column 0: [7,0,0,7,7]\n column 1: [7,0,0,7,7]\n column 2: [7,7,7,7,7] -> this has five 7s, but output row2 has 7,7,4,4,7.\n\n Let's try to see if we take specific columns.\n\n For output row0: first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> input row3, first five columns: that's row3[0:5] = [7,7,7,7,7] -> matches.\n For output row1: first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> input row4, first five: [7,7,7,7,7] -> matches.\n For output row2: [7,7,4,4,7] -> input row0, but not the first five. How about we take from row0 the non-zero values in the first however many? \n\n row0: [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> non-zero: positions0,1,2,6,7,8,9 -> values: 7,7,7,7,7,7,4 -> then take first five? 7,7,7,7,7 -> not 7,7,4,4,7.\n\n How about we take the first five non-zero values in row0? That would be 7,7,7 (positions0,1,2) then we need two more -> next non-zero is position6:7, then position7:7 -> 7,7,7,7,7 -> still not.\n\n Alternatively, we take the non-zero values but in the order of appearance, and we take five, but we have to include the 4? \n\n This is not working.\n\n Notice that in the output row2: [7,7,4,4,7] -> this might come from the last row of input? row4: [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7] -> if we take the first two 7s, then the last two 7s are after zeros, but we have 4s? \n\n The input has 4 only in the last column of the first three rows and in row3 and row4 as well? \n\n row0: last element is 4.\n row1: last element is 4.\n row2: last element is 4.\n row3: last element is 4.\n row4: last element is 7.\n\n So the 4s are in the last column of the first four rows.\n\n For output row2: we have 4,4 in the middle. How are these obtained? \n\n In the input, the only 4s are in the last column. \n\n So we must be combining information from multiple places.\n\n Let's go back to the training examples.\n\n In Example 2, we figured out that for each output row, we sort the corresponding input row (from a specific set) and take the first three, then append the first three of the first input row.\n\n In Example 1, if we try that:\n\n We are to use which rows? In Example 2, we used the last few rows: row3, row4, row5 (index 3,4,5) for the output.\n\n In Example 1, input has 7 rows. If we use the last few? Say row2, row3, row4, row5, row6? But output has 4 rows.\n\n Perhaps we use row2, row3, row4, row5.\n\n For row2: [4,7,1,7,4,7,5] -> sort: [1,4,4,5,7,7,7] -> first three: [1,4,4] -> then append first three of row0: [4,4,4] -> [1,4,4,4,4,4] -> but output row3 is [1,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4] -> not matching.\n\n Alternatively, take the last three after sort? For row2: sorted [1,4,4,5,7,7,7] -> last three: [7,7,7] -> then append [4,4,4] -> [7,7,7,4,4,4] -> but output row0 is [7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4] -> not.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n Let me try a different strategy for Example 1.\n\n Output row0: first six from row5, last four from row0.\n Output row1: ? \n Output row2: ?\n Output row3: has a 1, which is in row2.\n\n How about output row1: from row1? But how?\n\n Perhaps we are to take the non-4 values from the row and then pad to six elements by repeating the last non-4 value or something.\n\n For row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> non-4: [7,7,7,7,5] -> then to get six elements, repeat the last value? [7,7,7,7,5,5] -> then we have [7,7,7,7,5,5] -> but output has [7,7,5,5,5,7] -> not the same.\n\n Sort the non-4 values? [5,7,7,7,7] -> then repeat to six: [5,7,7,7,7,7] -> then append row0 first four: [5,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4] -> but output row1 is [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4] -> still not.\n\n Another idea: the first six of the output for each row is the row itself from the input, but with 4s replaced by the number from the first row at the same position.\n\n For output row0: they took row5: [7,7,7,7,7,7,5] -> first six are already without 4? So fine.\n\n For output row1: input row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> replace col0=4 with row0[0]=4 -> but we don't want 4, we want to remove it or change it.\n\n If we replace the 4s with the corresponding value from row0, then row1 becomes: \n col0: row0[0]=4 -> stays 4? But we want to remove 4s? \n\n This is not yielding.\n\n Let's try to see the output row1: [7,7,5,5,5,7] \n In the input, row1 has two 4s. If we remove the 4s, we get [7,7,7,7,5] -> then we are missing one element.\n\n Perhaps we duplicate the 5 to make three 5s? Then [7,7,7,7,5,5,5] -> too many.\n\n We then take the first six: [7,7,7,7,5,5] -> but output has [7,7,5,5,5,7] -> not the same.\n\n This is taking too long.\n\n Let me try to look for commonality in the test case and examples.\n\n In the test case, the last four of the output are 0,0,0,0 for all rows.\n\n In Example 1, the last four of the output are 4,4,4,4 for all rows.\n In Example 2, the last three of the output are 9,9,9 for all rows.\n\n So the last part is constant per example and comes from the first row of the input? \n In Example 2, the last three are from the first row of input ( first three 9s).\n In Example 1, the last four are from the first row of input ( first four 4s).\n In the test case, the last four are 0,0,0,0. Is this from the first row of input? The first row has [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> the first three 0s are there, but we need four 0s. The first row has three 0s. So not exactly.\n\n How about from the row that has the most 0s? Or from a specific part.\n\n in the test case, the last four are 0,0,0,0. The first row has three 0s, second row has three 0s, third row has three 0s, fourth row has one 0, fifth row has three 0s. So not constant.\n\n Perhaps the last part is always the same and is taken from the first row, but only the zeros or something.\n\n This is not consistent.\n\n Another idea: in all cases, the output grid is built by taking, for each row in the output, a part from a corresponding input row and then appending a constant array taken from the first row of the input, but only a portion of it.\n\n In Example 2: we appended the first three of the first row.\n In Example 1: we appended the first four of the first row.\n In the test case: if we are to append the first something of the first row, the first row has [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> if we take the first four: [7,7,7,0] -> but the output has 0,0,0,0 at the end. Not matching.\n\n Unless we take the zeros from the first row? The first row has three zeros at positions 3,4,5. Then we need four zeros, so not enough.\n\n In the test case output, the last four are 0,0,0,0, which is four zeros. The input has a row with many zeros? The first three rows have three zeros each, but not four in a row.\n\n How about we take the last four of the first row? [7,7,7,4] -> not zeros.\n\n This is not working.\n\n Let's try to see the first part of the output in the test case.\n\n For row0: first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> from row3: first five.\n For row1: first five: 7,7,7,7,7 -> from row4: first five.\n For row2: first five: 7,7,4,4,7 -> how to get this?\n\n In the input, if we look at column 6: \n row0:7, row1:7, row2:7, row3:7, row4:0 -> not.\n\n row at index 2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> if we take the non-zero values: [7,7,7,7,4] -> then take first five: [7,7,7,7,4] -> but we want 7,7,4,4,7 -> not.\n\n Another idea: perhaps for row2 of output, we are taking the values from the input where the row index is 2 and the column index is specific.\n\n Let's list the input row2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4]\n\n We need [7,7,4,4,7] -> we have 7 at position2, then 7 at position6,7,8, and 4 at position9.\n\n How about positions 2,6,7,8,9: [7,7,7,7,4] -> not [7,7,4,4,7].\n\n Unless we sort or something.\n\n Perhaps we are to use the number 4 from the last column of the earlier rows.\n\n For example, in output row2, the 4,4 might come from the last column of row0 and row1 or something.\n\n row0 last:4\n row1 last:4\n so two 4s.\n\n Then the 7,7,7 might come from row2 itself? but we have to have 7,7 at the beginning, then 4,4, then a 7.\n\n So [7,7] from where? then [4,4] from row0 and row1 last, then [7] from row2 somewhere.\n\n This is not systematic.\n\n Let's notice that in the output for the test case, row2: [7,7,4,4,7] -> this is similar to the input row0 if we take the non-0 values and then some adjustment.\n\n input row0: [7,7,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> non-0: [7,7,7,7,7,7,4] -> then if we take the first two 7s, then the last two 7s are at the end, but we have 4 at the end.\n\n Perhaps we take the first two, then the last two before the 4, then the 4, but that would be [7,7,7,7,4] -> not.\n\n Given the complexity, and since we have to provide an answer, let's try to reverse-engineer the test case.\n\n The correct output for the test case is:\n [\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [7,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [9,7,4,4,7,0,0,0,0]\n ]\n\n We see that for the first two rows, the first five are 7,7,7,7,7 and the last four are 0,0,0,0.\n For the last two rows, the first five are [7,7,4,4,7] and [9,7,4,4,7] and then 0,0,0,0.\n\n How about the first five of row0 and row1 of output come from the first five of row3 and row4 of input.\n For row2 and row3 of output, the first five come from the last column of the first three rows and then something else.\n\n Specifically, for output row2: [7,7,4,4,7]\n In the input, the last column (index 9) of row0:4, row1:4, row2:4, row3:4, row4:7.\n So if we take the last column of row0, row1, row2, row3, row4: [4,4,4,4,7] -> not [7,7,4,4,7].\n\n How about we take the last column of row0 and row1 for the 4,4, and then for the 7,7,7, from somewhere else.\n\n output row2 has two 7s at the beginning. In the input, row2 has a 7 at position2, and also at positions6,7,8.\n\n Perhaps output row2 is built from the input row2 and the last column of row0 and row1.\n\n input row2: [0,0,7,0,0,0,7,7,7,4] -> if we take the non-zero values in row2: [7,7,7,7,4] -> then we have four 7s and a 4.\n Then for the output, we want two 7s, then two 4s, then a 7.\n\n So perhaps we take the first two non-zero: 7,7 (from positions2 and6? but position2 is the first non-zero? Then position6 is next non-zero) -> [7,7] then the last column of row0 and row1: [4,4] -> [7,7,4,4] then the next non-zero in row2: position7:7 -> [7,7,4,4,7]. Perfect.\n\n Similarly for output row3: [9,7,4,4,7] -> \n input row1: [0,0,7,0,7,0,7,9,7,4] -> non-zero: [7,7,7,9,7,4] -> first two non-zero: 7,7 (positions2 and4) -> [7,7] then last column of row0 and row1: row0 last=4, row1 last=4 -> [4,4] then next non-zero in row1: after position4, next is position6:7, position7:9, position8:7, position9:4 -> next is 7 -> so [7,7,4,4,7] -> but output has [9,7,4,4,7] -> not matching because the first should be 9? \n\n For row3 of output, it should correspond to input row1? But we have to start with 9.\n\n In the output row3, the first number is 9, which is in input row1 at position7.\n\n Perhaps we take the non-zero values in a specific order: by column index? \n\n input row1: non-zero values at positions: 2:7, 4:7, 6:7, 7:9, 8:7, 9:4 -> sorted by position: [7,7,7,9,7,4] -> then first two: 7,7 -> then last column of row0 and row1: 4,4 -> then next: 7 -> [7,7,4,4,7] -> but we need [9,7,4,4,7].\n\n Alternatively, we take the non-zero values in the order of appearance, but skip the first one? \n\n This is not matching.\n\n For output row3: [9,7,4,4,7] -> the 9 might come from input row1 position7, then 7 from somewhere, then 4,4 from last column of row0 and row1, then 7 from row1.\n\n But how to systematize.\n\n Perhaps for output row2 and row3, we are taking a specific cell and then the last column of the previous rows.\n\n output row2: \n  first: the first non-zero in row2 -> position2:7\n  second: the next non-zero in row2 -> position6:7\n  third: last column of row0:4\n  fourth: last column of row1:4\n  fifth: the next non-zero in row2 -> position7:7\n\n Then [7,7,4,4,7]\n\n output row3:\n  first: the first non-zero in row1? -> position2:7 -> but output has 9 first.\n  or the last non-zero in row1? -> position9:4 -> not.\n\n Perhaps for row3, we take the non-zero values in row1 in order, but we only take five: positions with non-zero: 2,4,6,7,8,9 -> values:7,7,7,9,7,4 -> take the first five: 7,7,7,9,7 -> then we have [7,7,7,9,7] -> but output is [9,7,4,4,7] -> not.\n\n How about we take the non-zero values in row1, but then replace the first three with the last column of the first three rows? This is arbitrary.\n\n Given the time, let's assume for the test case:\n- The last four of every output row are 0,0,0,0. This might be a constant.\n- The first five of output row0 and row1 are the first five of input row3 and row4.\n- For output row2: it is built as: take the first two non-zero of input row2 (which are at positions2 and6: both 7), then the last column value of input row0 (4), then of row1 (4), then the next non-zero in row2 ( position7:7) -> [7,7,4,4,7]\n- For output row3: similarly, take the first two non-zero of input row1: positions2 and4: 7 and 7 -> [7,7], then last column of row0 and row1: 4 and 4 -> [4,4], then the next non-zero in row1: position6:7 -> [7,7,4,4,7] -> but the output has [9,7,4,4,7] -> so it's not matching.\n\n unless for row3, we take a different row.\n\n output row3 has a 9, which is in input row1 at position7.\n\n Perhaps for output row3, we take the non-zero values in input row1 starting from the last non-zero? Or from the highest number.\n\n input row1 non-zero: [7,7,7,9,7,4] -> if we take the highest number first? 9, then the next highest? 7, then 7, etc -> [9,7,7,7,7,4] -> then first five: [9,7,7,7,7] -> but output has [9,7,4,4,7] -> not matching.\n\n Perhaps we are to take the unique numbers or something.\n\n Let's try to see the pattern in the first training example.\n\n In Example 1, output row1: [7,7,5,5,5,7,4,4,4,4]\n\n In the input, for row1: [4,7,7,7,4,7,5] -> non-zero: [7,7,7,7,5] -> if we sort in descending order: [7,7,7,7,5] -> then take the first six? But we have only five, so perhaps repeat the last or something.\n\n This is not consistent.\n\n Given the complexity, and since we have to provide an answer, let's focus on the test case and assume a pattern.\n\n For the test case:\n- output row0: first five from input row3 first five: [7,7,7,7,7]\n- output row1: first five from input row4 first five: [7,7,7,7,7]\n- output row2: first five: [7,7,4,4,7] -> this can be: \n   input row2 has non-zero: positions2:7,6:7,7:7,8:7,9:4 -> if we take the first two non-zero: 7,7 (positions2 and6), then the last two of the first row's last element ( wait, we need two 4s) -> the last element of row0 is 4, of row1 is 4 -> so use those, then the next non-zero in row2: position7:7 -> [7,7,4,4,7]\n- output row3: [9,7,4,4,7] -> input row1 has non-zero: positions2:7,4:7,6:7,7:9,8:7,9:4 -> take the first non-zero is position2:7, but we want 9 first. So perhaps take the highest value in the row first? 9, then the next highest is 7, then we need 4,4 from somewhere. The 4,4 can be from the last element of row0 and row1, then the next highest might be 7. So [9,7,4,4,7]\n\n So the procedure for the first five of each output row is:\n- For output row i:\n   if i < 2, then take the first five of input row (3+i) [because row3 and row4]\n   else (i>=2) then \n        if i==2, use input row2\n        if i==3, use input row1\n        and then: \n          take the highest number in that row as the first number, \n          then the next highest as the second number,\n          then the last element of input row0 as the third number,\n          then the last element of input row1 as the fourth number,\n          then the next highest number in the row as the fifth number.\n\n But for row2: highest is 7, next highest is 7 (since all are 7 or 4), then last of row0=4, last of row1=4, then next highest=7.\n For row3: highest=9, next highest=7, then 4,4, then next highest=7.\n\n This matches.\n\n Then for the last part, in all output rows, we append [0,0,0,0] for the test case.\n\n In Example 1, for output row0: first six from row5, then last four from row0 first four.\n For row1: we can apply the same logic as above for the first six? But in Example 1, for row1 of output, if we use input row1, the highest number is 7, next highest 7, then what for the next? We need six numbers.\n\n This is not general.\n\n Perhaps for the first part of the output, it is the beginning of a specific row, and for the last part, it is the beginning of the first row.\n\n In the test case, we are appending [0,0,0,0] which is not from the first row.\n\n Given the instructions, we are to speculate.\n\n Let's assume for the test case the pattern is:\n\n - The output has 4 rows.\n - The last four columns are always [0,0,0,0] (a constant).\n - The first five columns for row0 and row1 are the first five of input row3 and row4.\n - For row2: take the non-zero values of input row2 in order of appearance, but only the first five non-zero values? Input row2 non-zero: positions2:7,6:7,7:7,8:7,9:4 -> [7,7,7,7,4] -> but we want [7,7,4,4,7] -> not.\n - For row3: similarly [7,7,7,9,7] -> not [9,7,4,4,7].\n\n We must have to incorporate the last column of other rows.\n\n Since the correct answer is given, and we have to explain, let's say that the grid is split and parts are combined.\n\n Given the time, I will provide a response based on the following speculation for the test case:\n\n The output is generated by:\n 1. For the first two output rows, take the first five elements from the last two rows of the input (row3 and row4).\n 2. For the last two output rows, take a combination: \n    - For row2 of output: take the first two non-zero values from input row2, then the last element of input row0, then the last element of input row1, then the next non-zero value from input row2.\n    - For row3 of output: take the largest number in input row1 (9), then the next largest number (7), then the last element of input row0 (4), then the last element of input row1 (4), then the next largest number in input row1 (7).\n 3. Then append four zeros to each row.\n\n This matches the correct answer for the test case.\n\n Now for the simple explanation in the JSON.\n\n But note that in the training examples, we had different patterns.\n\n Since the user sees emojis, we can explain in simple terms.\n\n patternDescription: \"The aliens are showing us how to combine parts of their messages. They take the beginning of some rows and then add extra information from other parts.\"\n\n solvingStrategy: \n - First, look at the input grid.\n - For the first few rows of the output, take the beginning of some rows from the input.\n - For the remaining rows of the output, build them by taking numbers from one row and then the last numbers from the first few rows.\n - Finally, add the same ending to every row.\n\n But this is vague.\n\n Alternatively, based on the test case only:\n\n \"In this puzzle, the aliens want us to create a new grid with 4 rows. For the first two rows, copy the first five numbers from the last two rows of the input. For the third row, take the first two non-zero numbers from the third row of the input, then the last number from the first row, then the last number from the second row, then the next non-zero number from the third row. For the fourth row, find the largest number in the second row of the input and use it first, then the next largest number, then the last number from the first row, then the last number from the second row, then the next largest number from the second row. Then, add four zeros at the end of every row.\"\n\n But this is specific to the test case and may not be the general rule.\n\n Given the instructions to speculate, and since we have to output JSON, I will do my best.\n\n Let's assume that the general pattern is to take, for each output row, a section from the input grid, and then append a constant array.\n\n For the test case, the constant array is [0,0,0,0].\n\n In Example 1, the constant array is [4,4,4,4] (from the first row).\n\n In Example 2, the constant array is [9,9,9] (from the first row).\n\n So the constant array is the first few elements of the first row of the input, but in Example 2 it was the first three, in Example 1 the first four, in the test case it is not from the first row.\n\n unless in the test case, the constant array is [0,0,0,0] because the first row has zeros, but we took four zeros even though there are only three.\n\n This is inconsistent.\n\n Perhaps the constant array is always a sequence of the most common number or something.\n\n Given the above, I will provide a response.",
