      "patternDescription": "The aliens are changing the outer parts of the pattern to be more symmetrical and balanced, making the edges match in a certain way while keeping the middle the same.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the puzzle as numbers, not emojis. Look at the first and last columns and the top and bottom rows. Notice that in the answer, the outer edges are changed to a specific value (like 5) to make the pattern more symmetrical. The middle part stays the same. So, the aliens are adjusting the edges to create a balanced shape, while keeping the center unchanged.",
      "hints": [
        "Focus on the outer edges of the grid",
        "Observe how the edges change from input to output",
        "Remember that the middle often stays the same while edges are modified for symmetry or balance"

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to tell us to make things more balanced or harmonious. They could be suggesting that we need to think about symmetry or fairness, maybe showing us how to fix or improve our patterns or even our world. It doesn't seem hostile; it looks more like a message about balance and harmony.",
