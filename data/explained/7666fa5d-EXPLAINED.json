      "reasoningLog": "**Analyzing symmetrical patterns**\n\nI’m examining an input arrangement where the third column and eighth column both have 3s. The distance between these 3s is five columns apart, and I notice an increase in the number of 2s filling the area, more than in the previous row. It seems the pattern creates a triangle shape descending from the diagonal 3s. The output displays triangular patches of 2s forming around the 3s, which could also be seen as replacing empty areas until they hit another 3 or the grid's edge.\n**Systematically analyzing Example2**\n\nI'm going to take a closer, structured look at Example2. I'll start by listing the positions of 3s in the matrix. In Row 1, there's a 3 in column 12, and in Row 2, it's in column 11. Rows 3 to 16 each show various 3 placements along two down-right diagonals, giving a horizontally symmetrical pattern. The output has a lot of 2s filling the spaces between these diagonals, creating a thick, X-shaped band. For instance, Row 8 has a 3 in column 9, with 2s filling around it.\n**Examining filling patterns**\n\nI'm considering how the cells in the output fill according to the 3s, especially around row 8. It looks like they fill from column 1 to the boundary, but not consistently across all rows. For example, in row 8, there's a 3 in column 9, while the output has 2s in columns 2-8 and 10-15. I think the reason there's no 2 in column 1 is due to a previous 3 blocking that area. It appears the 2s are filling the space within the parallelogram formed by those oblique 3 lines.\n**Identifying diagonal filling patterns**\n\nI'm noticing there are two descending diagonals of 3s, creating a diamond-shaped area between them that gets filled with 2s, including some diagonal expansions. In rows with two 3s, like rows 3 to 15, I expect the horizontal span between them to fill with 2s. For example, in row 4, with 3s at columns 4 and 9, I see columns 5 through 8 have only two 2s at 5 and 6, with 8s at 7 and 8. It's not a straight fill; it seems more triangular instead of horizontal.\n**Revisiting output comparison**\n\nI’m checking the output for row 7, which is supposed to match the correct answers. The third line after the header indicates the expected row. Row 7’s output aligns with the correct answer once I recall the 1-based indexing—there's a 9 in both the output and input at the same positions. It seems the rule involves filling between diagonals with 2s, following a pattern that creates a triangular shape. The gap's width affects the count of filled 2s, and I realized overlapping effects may cause additional fills.\n**Analyzing diagonal patterns**\n\nI’m trying to understand why there are 2s positioned between certain columns, particularly around the 9s. It looks like the rule involves extending the length of a series of 2s as I move down row by row. I see a pattern where the 2-run lengths increase toward the bottom, but there are inconsistencies. It’s possible that the length of the 2s corresponds to the space between neighboring 9s, filling areas shaped like bands formed between diagonals. I think the overall approach involves filling the southeast area, ensuring I don’t cross any markers.\n**Simplifying explanation of shadows**\n\nI’m proposing a simpler approach: First, identify all the non-8 colored cells. These create 45-degree diagonals. For every cell on a diagonal, I’ll paint 2s to the right; in the next row, I’ll shift the painting one column over, creating triangular shapes. The process stops when hitting another colored cell or another triangle's edge. Interestingly, the output shows for row 6 that the left 9 at col 4 creates a \"shadow\" of 2s. The key seems to be that the lengths increase by one with each row until they hit the next diagonal.\n**Clarifying the shadow filling rule**\n\nI’m realizing there might have been a misinterpretation in run shifts. Initially, I defined runs based on the left 9, which grows by +1 per row. The triangle shape has constraints based on column positions related to rows. For instance, at row 6, it seems I can only fill one 2 at col 5. Yet there are two 2s visible in row 6. This leads me to hypothesize that perhaps the triangles overlap or have further constraints. \n\nUltimately, I’m leaning toward a simpler transformation: if an 8 is situated between two 9s, it can be changed to a 2, creating a visually appealing fill. This shouldn't overcomplicate things!\n**Summarizing the transformation rules**\n\nOkay, it seems I've been overcomplicating things a bit while trying to reason through the rows and the diagonal fills. At row 7, I noticed the start positions for filling should actually remain consistent across rows, but that doesn't align with the observations I've made. \n\nI think I need a higher-level overview instead. The transformation involves identifying diagonal lines of a specific color, then the output adds color 2 to fill gaps in the lower-right direction. This filling creates a staircase pattern and stops when hitting another colored line. The original colors remain unchanged. Now, let’s simplify the explanation into clear steps and hints for better understanding.",

      "patternDescription": "There is one special color (4 in example 1, 3 in example 2, 9 in the test) laid out along 45° down-right diagonals. The output keeps these colored guide-pixels unchanged and adds color 2 to fill the empty space between neighboring diagonals. The fill grows in a stepped, rightward/downward way (like a staircase or a right-angled triangular ‘shadow’) from each guide diagonal until it would touch the next guide diagonal. No 2s are placed outside or across a guide line; original colored cells are never changed.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1) Find all non-8 cells; they form one or more down-right diagonals of the same color. 2) Think of each diagonal as a border. The space between two adjacent diagonals is the area to be filled. 3) Fill that space with color 2 in a step-by-step, row-by-row manner: on a row that contains a guide cell, start placing 2s to the right of it, but stop before the next guide cell on that row. 4) Moving down each subsequent row, let that run of 2s expand (one more cell) and/or shift as needed, but always stop just before the next guide diagonal in that row. 5) Repeat between every neighboring pair of diagonals. 6) Leave the original colored cells (3/4/9) as they are; everything else stays 8 unless it becomes part of the filled region (2).",

        "The 2s only appear between these borders, growing like a staircase to the right/down, and never crossing a border.",
        "Nothing about the original special-colored pixels changes; all newly added pixels are color 2."
