      "reasoningLog": "We are given training examples and a test case. All inputs are 3x3 grids with identical rows. The outputs are also 3x3 grids with identical rows.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[5,8,6],[5,8,6],[5,8,6]]\nOutput: [[1,9,2],[1,9,2],[1,9,2]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[2,3,8],[2,3,8],[2,3,8]]\nOutput: [[6,4,9],[6,4,9],[6,4,9]]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [[9,4,2],[9,4,2],[9,4,2]]\nOutput: [[8,3,6],[8,3,6],[8,3,6]]\n\nExample 4:\nInput: [[3,1,2],[3,1,2],[3,1,2]]\nOutput: [[4,5,6],[4,5,6],[4,5,6]]\n\nTest Case:\nInput: [[8,1,3],[8,1,3],[8,1,3]]\nCorrect Answer: [[9,5,4],[9,5,4],[9,5,4]]\n\nWe notice that in each example, the input grid has the same row repeated three times, and the output grid also has the same row repeated three times. Therefore, we can focus on the transformation of a single row.\n\nLet me denote a row as [A, B, C] for input and [X, Y, Z] for output.\n\nFrom the examples:\n\nEx1: Input row: [5,8,6] -> Output: [1,9,2]\nEx2: [2,3,8] -> [6,4,9]\nEx3: [9,4,2] -> [8,3,6]\nEx4: [3,1,2] -> [4,5,6]\n\nTest: [8,1,3] -> [9,5,4]\n\nWe need to find a transformation that maps [A,B,C] to [X,Y,Z].\n\nLooking at the numbers, it doesn't seem to be a simple arithmetic operation (like addition or multiplication) because the outputs are not consistent with that.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the positions:\n\nNotice that in each example, the output row does not contain the same numbers as the input row? Actually, sometimes they do? Let's check:\n\nEx1: Input: 5,8,6 -> Output: 1,9,2 -> no overlap? (5,8,6 vs 1,9,2)\nEx2: 2,3,8 -> 6,4,9 -> no overlap? (2,3,8 vs 6,4,9)\nEx3: 9,4,2 -> 8,3,6 -> 2 is in both? But 2 is in input and 6 in output? Actually, 2 is in input and 6 in output? Not the same number? The numbers are different.\nEx4: 3,1,2 -> 4,5,6 -> no overlap.\n\nBut wait, in Ex3: input has 2 and output has 6? And 2 maps to 👽 and 6 maps to 🛸? Not the same.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is a permutation of the numbers? But the sets are changing? In Ex1: input set {5,8,6}, output {1,9,2} - different sets.\n\nBut notice that the numbers in the output are always 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9? And input also? Actually, in the examples, we see numbers from 1 to 9, but 0 and 7 are missing? In the mapping, 0 and 7 are defined but not used in these examples.\n\nWait, in the test case, input has 8,1,3 and output has 9,5,4. Also, in the examples, we have:\n\nEx1: input: 5,8,6 -> output: 1,9,2\nEx2: input: 2,3,8 -> output: 6,4,9\nEx3: input: 9,4,2 -> output: 8,3,6\nEx4: input: 3,1,2 -> output: 4,5,6\n\nNow, let me see if there's a pattern by looking at each position.\n\nPosition 1 (first element):\nEx1: 5 -> 1\nEx2: 2 -> 6\nEx3: 9 -> 8\nEx4: 3 -> 4\nTest: 8 -> 9\n\nPosition 2:\nEx1: 8 -> 9\nEx2: 3 -> 4\nEx3: 4 -> 3\nEx4: 1 -> 5\nTest: 1 -> 5\n\nPosition 3:\nEx1: 6 -> 2\nEx2: 8 -> 9\nEx3: 2 -> 6\nEx4: 2 -> 6\nTest: 3 -> 4\n\nWait, position 3 in Ex1: 6->2, Ex2:8->9, Ex3:2->6, Ex4:2->6. Not consistent.\n\nBut note that in Ex3 and Ex4, the third input is 2 and output is 6? But in Ex1, 6->2 and in Ex2, 8->9.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's a substitution based on a fixed rule. Let me try to find a function f such that for each input number, it maps to an output number? But then in a row, the same input number might appear? Actually, in the examples, the input row has distinct numbers? Let's check:\n\nEx1: [5,8,6] -> distinct\nEx2: [2,3,8] -> distinct\nEx3: [9,4,2] -> distinct\nEx4: [3,1,2] -> distinct\nTest: [8,1,3] -> distinct\n\nSo each row has three distinct numbers.\n\nNow, the output row also has three distinct numbers? Yes.\n\nBut if it were a simple function, then the same input number should map to the same output number? Let's check:\n\nLook at the number 8:\nIn Ex1: input 8 (second position) -> output 9? (second position in output is 9)\nIn Ex2: input 8 (third position) -> output 9? (third position in output is 9)\nIn Test: input 8 (first position) -> output 9? (first position in output is 9)\n\nSo 8 always maps to 9? \n\nNow, number 2:\nIn Ex2: input 2 (first) -> output 6? (first in output is 6)\nIn Ex3: input 2 (third) -> output 6? (third in output is 6)\nIn Ex4: input 2 (third) -> output 6? (third in output is 6)\n\nSo 2 always maps to 6.\n\nNumber 6:\nIn Ex1: input 6 (third) -> output 2? (third in output is 2)\n\nSo 6 maps to 2? \n\nBut 2 maps to 6 and 6 maps to 2? So they swap?\n\nSimilarly, let's check 5:\nEx1: input 5 (first) -> output 1? (first in output is 1)\n\nEx4: input 5? Not present.\n\nTest: input 5? Not present.\n\nBut in Ex4, input has 1, which in Ex1 output has 1? But in Ex4, input 1 (second) -> output 5? (second in output is 5)\n\nSo 1 maps to 5? And 5 maps to 1? Swap?\n\nNow, number 3:\nEx2: input 3 (second) -> output 4? (second in output is 4)\nEx4: input 3 (first) -> output 4? (first in output is 4)\nTest: input 3 (third) -> output 4? (third in output is 4? In test output is [9,5,4], so third is 4)\n\nSo 3 maps to 4.\n\nNumber 4:\nEx3: input 4 (second) -> output 3? (second in output is 3)\n\nSo 4 maps to 3? Swap with 3?\n\nAnd number 9:\nEx3: input 9 (first) -> output 8? (first in output is 8)\n\nIn test, input 9? Not present, but output has 9 from input 8.\n\nSo let's list the mappings we have:\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- 2 -> 6\n- 6 -> 2\n- 8 -> 9\n- 9 -> 8\n- 3 -> 4\n- 4 -> 3\n- 5 -> 1\n- 1 -> 5\n\nNow, what about 7? Not used.\n0? Not used.\n\nIn Ex4: input [3,1,2] -> [4,5,6]: \n3->4, 1->5, 2->6, which matches.\n\nIn Ex1: [5,8,6] -> [1,9,2]: 5->1, 8->9, 6->2? But 6->2 is consistent, but 5->1 and 8->9 are also consistent.\n\nIn Ex2: [2,3,8] -> [6,4,9]: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9.\n\nIn Ex3: [9,4,2] -> [8,3,6]: 9->8, 4->3, 2->6.\n\nPerfect! So it seems that each number is mapped to another number via a fixed mapping. Specifically, it appears that the mapping is:\n\n1 ↔ 5 (each maps to the other)\n2 ↔ 6\n3 ↔ 4\n8 ↔ 9\n\nAnd 0 and 7 are not used in these examples.\n\nSo the transformation is simply: for each number in the input, replace it with its pair.\n\nNow, for the test case: input [8,1,3] should map to [9,5,4] because:\n8 -> 9\n1 -> 5\n3 -> 4\n\nWhich matches the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the logic is a fixed substitution (mapping) of numbers.\n\nBut note: the user sees emojis, so we should explain in terms of emojis.\n\nGiven the emoji map:\n\n0: ⬛\n1: ✅\n2: 👽\n3: 👤\n4: 🪐\n5: 🌍\n6: 🛸\n7: ☄️\n8: ♥\n9: ⚠️\n\nThe mapping we found:\n\n1 (✅) ↔ 5 (🌍)\n2 (👽) ↔ 6 (🛸)\n3 (👤) ↔ 4 (🪐)\n8 (♥) ↔ 9 (⚠️)\n\nSo for each emoji, replace it with its paired emoji.\n\nNow, for the test input: [8,1,3] which is [♥, ✅, 👤] should become [⚠️, 🌍, 🪐] which is [9,5,4].\n\nNow, to explain in simple terms:\n\nThe pattern is that each symbol is swapped with a specific partner symbol. Think of it like a dance where each alien has a human partner, and each planet has a symbol partner. So every time you see one, you swap it with its fixed partner.\n\nSolving strategy: \n1. Since the grid has the same row repeated, you only need to solve one row.\n2. For each symbol in the row, replace it with its partner symbol according to the fixed pairs we learned from the examples.\n3. The pairs are: \n   - ✅ (yes) swaps with 🌍 (Earth)\n   - 👽 (alien) swaps with 🛸 (ship)\n   - 👤 (human) swaps with 🪐 (their planet)\n   - ♥ (peace) swaps with ⚠️ (warning)\n\nIn the test case: \nInput row: ♥, ✅, 👤\nSwap ♥ with ⚠️, ✅ with 🌍, 👤 with 🪐 → becomes ⚠️, 🌍, 🪐\n\nHints:\n- Key insight 1: Each symbol has a fixed partner that it always swaps with.\n- Key insight 2: The grid rows are identical, so you can focus on transforming one row.\n- Key insight 3: From the training examples, we can learn the swapping pairs.\n\nAlien meaning: \nThe aliens are showing a transformation where symbols are swapped with their opposites or partners. \nSpecifically, peace (♥) becomes a warning (⚠️), agreement (✅) becomes Earth (🌍), human (👤) becomes their planet (🪐). \nThis might indicate that they are trying to show a relationship between these concepts. Perhaps they are saying that peace can turn into a warning if not careful, or that agreement leads to thinking of Earth, and humans are connected to their planet. \nBut note, in the context, the aliens are communicating puzzles, so it might not be hostile. However, swapping peace with warning might be a bit concerning. \nBut overall, it seems more like they are teaching us a coding system. \n\nConfidence: \nI am very confident about the transformation being a fixed swap, as it perfectly fits all examples and the test case. Confidence: 95\n\nAlien meaning confidence: \nThis is more speculative. The swap might represent a duality or a transformation between states. But without more context, it's hard. Confidence: 60\n\nNow, output in JSON.",
