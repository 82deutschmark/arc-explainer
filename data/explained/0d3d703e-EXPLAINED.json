Identify the transformation pattern by looking at the input and output pairs. 3. Notice that each number in the input is being changed to another number in the output consistently. 4. For the test case, convert the input emojis to numbers: [[8, 1, 3]] becomes [[8, 1, 3]]. 5. Apply the same transformation pattern observed in previous examples to each number. 6. Convert the resulting numbers back to emojis to get the final output.",

Since all three rows are identical in each example, the output for each column is just 3 times the input number in that column, modulo 10.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at the input matrix and notice all rows are the same. 2. For each column, add the three identical numbers together (multiply by 3). 3. Take the last digit of that sum (modulo 10). 4. Replace each number in the output matrix with that result, repeated for all rows and columns. 5. If you think in emojis, convert them back to numbers first, do the math, then convert the result back to emojis.",
      "hints": [
        "All input rows are identical, so focus on one row only.",
        "Output numbers come from multiplying input numbers by 3 and then taking only the last digit.",

      "alienMeaning": "The aliens are showing us a way to amplify or emphasize their signals by tripling their message elements but keeping the result within a single digit (0-9). Using their emoji map, they might be communicating that peace (♥) tripled leads to a warning (⚠️), friendship (♥) leads to attention, and so on. This could mean they want us to pay close attention to repeated signals and their intensified meanings, possibly a way to highlight important messages or warnings.",
