      "solvingStrategy": "1. Convert the emojis to numbers using the provided mapping. For example, ♥ becomes 8, ✅ becomes 1, etc. 2. Identify the transformation pattern by looking at the input and output pairs. 3. Notice that each number in the input is being changed to another number in the output consistently. 4. For the test case, convert the input emojis to numbers: [[8, 1, 3]] becomes [[8, 1, 3]]. 5. Apply the same transformation pattern observed in previous examples to each number. 6. Convert the resulting numbers back to emojis to get the final output.",
      "hints": [
        "The transformation adds a consistent value to each number.",
