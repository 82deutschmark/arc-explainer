  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed all training examples to identify the transformation pattern. Each input grid has 3 rows and 9 columns with values 0 or 5. The output always has 3 identical rows with values grouped in triplets. The pattern involves counting consecutive 5s in each row, then mapping these counts to specific output values. The mapping appears to be: count 1 → 9, count 2 → 4, count 3 → 3, count 4 → 6, count 5 → 1. For the test case, the first row has a count of 4 (consecutive 5s at positions 5-8), the second row has count 1 (single 5 at position 4), and the third row has count 4 (consecutive 5s at positions 0-3). This maps to 4→6, 1→9, 4→6, but this didn't match the pattern. Re-examined and realized the pattern is based on the positions of the 5s rather than just counts. The output values correspond to the starting positions of the 5 sequences: position 0→3, 1→4, 2→9, 3→1, 4→6. For the test case: row 1 5s start at position 5→?, row 2 at position 4→6, row 3 at position 0→3. But this didn't consistently match. Finally identified the correct pattern: the output is determined by the column indices where 5s appear. The first row's 5s define the first triplet value, second row's 5s define the second triplet, third row's 5s define the third triplet. The value is based on the starting column of the 5 sequence: 0→3, 1→4, 2→9, 3→1, 4→6, 5→? From examples: start 0→3 (ex3 row3), 1→4 (ex2 row1), 2→9 (ex1 row1), 3→1 (ex2 row3), 4→6 (ex4 row2), 5→? For test case: row1 5s start at col5, row2 at col4, row3 at col0. So triplet1: start5→?, triplet2: start4→6, triplet3: start0→3. But need mapping for start5. Looking at ex1: row2 5s at col4? Actually, careful: each row's 5 sequence defines one triplet. The mapping is: the output value for a triplet is 10 minus the starting column index? For start0: 10-0=10, but we have 3. Not that. Alternatively, the value might be the starting column index plus something. From examples: start0→3, start1→4, start2→9, start3→1, start4→6. Not linear. Another idea: the value is based on the number of 5s in the sequence? But ex1 row1: 3 fives →3, row2: ? Actually, row2 has 5s at col0,2,4,7? Not consecutive. So it's about consecutive sequences. For test case: row1 has consecutive 5s from col5 to8: start5, length4. row2: single 5 at col4: start4, length1. row3: consecutive 5s from col0 to3: start0, length4. Now, mapping from (start, length) to value. But from examples: (0,3)→3, (2,3)→9? Ex1 row1: 5s at col0,1,2: start0, length3→3. Row2: not consecutive. Ex2 row1: 5 at col2: start2, length1→9? But output has 9 for first triplet. So for single 5, it uses the start position. So value = f(start). From data: f(0)=3, f(1)=4, f(2)=9, f(3)=1, f(4)=6. f(5)=? Since not in examples, but from pattern, it might be cyclic or based on something else. Notice that 3,4,9,1,6 are not in order. Alternatively, the value might be the start index plus 3, but 0+3=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5 but we have 9. Not. Another thought: the value is the start index mapped through a fixed sequence: [3,4,9,1,6,...]. So for start5, it would be the next in sequence. What is the sequence? 3,4,9,1,6 — no obvious order. But from the test case, we need to predict. Given that in all outputs, the triplets are from the set {1,3,4,6,9}. So for start5, it should be one of these. Perhaps it is based on the row number? But output rows are identical. Finally, I realized that the output value for a triplet is determined by the row that has the 5s for that triplet. Specifically, the value is the same as the row index where the 5 sequence starts, but mapped: row0→3, row1→4, row2→9? But ex2: triplet1 from row0? Actually, in each example, the first triplet comes from the row that has the leftmost 5s. In ex1, row0 has leftmost at col0, value3; row1 has at col0? But value4? Not consistent. After re-examining, I found the pattern: the output is always three identical rows, each divided into three triplets. The value of each triplet is determined by the starting column of the sequence of 5s in the corresponding row of the input. The mapping is: start column 0 -> 3, 1 -> 4, 2 -> 9, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 6. For start column 5, it is not in the training examples, but by extrapolation, it might be the next in the sequence: 5 -> ? The sequence is 3,4,9,1,6. This looks like the digits of pi or something, but not. Alternatively, it might be based on the number of 5s, but from ex2, row1 has start2, length1, value9. So not. Another idea: the value is 10 - start for start<5, but 10-0=10, not 3. Not. Looking back at the test case input: row0: 5s at col5,6,7,8 (start5, length4), row1: 5 at col4 (start4, length1), row2: 5s at col0,1,2,3 (start0, length4). So for triplet1 (cols0-2): value from row2 start0 -> 3. Triplet2 (cols3-5): value from row1 start4 -> 6. Triplet3 (cols6-8): value from row0 start5 -> ?. Since start5 is new, but notice that in the output, the values are always 1,3,4,6,9. So for start5, it should be one of these. Perhaps it is 9, as in ex2 for start2. But why? I think I have to assume that the mapping is fixed: 0->3, 1->4, 2->9, 3->1, 4->6, and for 5, it might be the next, which is not defined, but from the pattern, it might wrap around to 0->3, so 5->3? Or based on the sequence, after 6 should be something, but not. Wait, in example 4, row2 has 5s at col6,7,8: start6? But value3. So start6 -> 3. So the mapping is modulo something. In example 4, the third triplet comes from row2 start6, and value is 3. And 6 mod 6 =0, which maps to 3. Similarly, start0->3. Start1->4, start2->9, start3->1, start4->6, start5->? should be start5 mod6=5, not in mapping. But start6 mod6=0->3. So for start5, it is not covered. However, in the test case, start5 is present. Perhaps the mapping is for start mod6: 0->3, 1->4, 2->9, 3->1, 4->6, 5->? . Since not in training, but from the values available, it might be 9 or 1. But let's list all starts from examples: ex1: row0:0, row1:0? but value4, so not based on start alone. I think I need to accept that for start5, it should be 9, as it is the only one left. So for test case: triplet1: from row2 start0 ->3, triplet2: from row1 start4 ->6, triplet3: from row0 start5 ->9. So output all rows: [3,3,3,6,6,6,9,9,9]. But wait, in the output, the triplets are in order of the columns, not the rows. So for cols0-2: value from the row that has 5s in that range? In test case, cols0-3 have 5s in row2, so value f(0)=3. Cols4-5: col4 has 5 in row1, col5 has 5 in row0, so which to use? The pattern is that each triplet of columns is assigned the value based on the row that has the earliest start of 5s in that triplet. For cols0-2, row2 has start0. For cols3-5, row1 has start4 (at col4), row0 has start5 later. So use row1: f(4)=6. For cols6-8, only row0 has 5s, start5 ->9. So output: [3,3,3,6,6,6,9,9,9] for each row. But this matches the available values. So I'll go with that.",
