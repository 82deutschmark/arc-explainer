The key insight is that the filled rectangle has its top-left corner at row 4, column 1 (0-indexed) and extends to cover a specific area. This pattern is consistent across all training examples where a 2x2 or larger rectangle starting at this position gets filled with color 2.",

    "Step 5: In Example 3, a more complex pattern emerges but still anchored at (4,1)",
