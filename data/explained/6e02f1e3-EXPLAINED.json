      "patternDescription": "The aliens are using a pattern of rotating the focus from one corner of the grid to another, then assigning a special code (5) to the position that was last active or prominent. Essentially, they highlight the 'center' or 'main point' of the pattern by transforming the input grid into a new grid with a single '5' in a specific position, indicating focus or importance.",
      "solvingStrategy": "First, think of the emoji grid as a number grid, where each number (0-5) is represented by emojis. Look at the original pattern and see which parts are most active or prominent. Then, observe where the 'focus' or 'most significant' part of the pattern moves or appears in the output. The key is to identify how the 'highlight' (the 5) shifts based on the pattern of the input. In simple terms, you're watching where the 'main spot' in the grid moves or changes, and marking that spot with a 5 in the answer.",
      "hints": [
        "Focus on the position of the 5 in the output as a clue for the 'main point' or 'focus' in the pattern.",
        "Note how the 5 always appears in a different position depending on the input grid.",
        "The other numbers turn into zeros, which suggests that only the 'main' or 'most important' part is being marked with 5."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "The aliens might be trying to show us where their attention or concern is, perhaps indicating a specific area of interest or importance. The use of 5 (which could symbolize 'Earth' or a significant point) suggests they are highlighting the key location or issue, possibly trying to communicate that their focus is on something specific or that they are emphasizing a point of importance. It doesn't seem hostile; instead, they might be trying to tell us 'this is the main thing' or 'pay attention here.'",

      "patternDescription": "The aliens look at each horizontal stripe (row) of symbols and check how many rows are “pure” (all the same). If the entire 3×3 block is one symbol, they just light up the top row. Otherwise, if two or three rows are uniform, they draw a main diagonal of 🌍. If only zero or one row is uniform, they draw an anti-diagonal of 🌍.",
      "solvingStrategy": "1. Look at your 3×3 pattern of emojis instead of numbers. 2. Ask: are all nine cells identical?  – Yes → fill the entire first row with 🌍 and leave the rest blank.  – No → continue. 3. For each of the three rows, check if that row is pure (all three emojis match). 4. Count how many pure rows you found. 5. If that count is 2 or 3 → place a 🌍 on the main diagonal (top-left, middle, bottom-right). 6. If that count is 0 or 1 → place a 🌍 on the anti-diagonal (top-right, middle, bottom-left). 7. All other positions are ⬛.",
      "hints": [
        "Treat rows as units: ‘pure’ means all three are identical.",
        "If the whole grid is pure, do the special top-row fill.",
        ">=2 pure rows → main diagonal; <2 pure rows → anti-diagonal."
      ],
      "alienMeaning": "They’re marking out our planet in different diagonal patterns depending on how uniform their scanning of each horizontal band is. It feels like a diagnostic or status signal—not outright hostility—but they could be signaling ‘all clear’ or ‘attention needed’ based on what they see in our rows. The anti-diagonal could mean ‘we have an anomaly’ while the main diagonal means ‘everything looks consistent.’",
