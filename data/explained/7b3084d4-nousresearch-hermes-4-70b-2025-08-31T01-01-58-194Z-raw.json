The regions are ordered based on their positions in the input grid, starting from the top-left and proceeding clockwise. Each region is then placed in the output grid in a way that preserves its shape and relative position.",

Determine the order of these regions based on their positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left). 3. Extract each region and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid. 4. Ensure the output grid dimensions match the largest region's dimensions.",
