    "solvingStrategy": "The problem involves analyzing the given training examples to identify a pattern or rule that can be applied to the test cases. The training examples show different input grids being transformed into output grids. By examining these examples, we can observe that the output grids seem to be derived by applying a specific rule to the input grids, such as selecting certain elements or patterns from the input and arranging them in the output. The key is to identify this rule and apply it to the test case inputs to generate the predicted outputs.",
    "keySteps": "1. Examine each training example to understand the input-output transformation. 2. Identify any consistent patterns or rules across all training examples. 3. Apply the discovered pattern or rule to the test case input to generate the predicted output.",
    "patternDescription": "The pattern involves selecting specific elements from the input grid and arranging them in a particular way in the output grid. This could involve selecting elements based on their position, value, or other criteria, and then applying some form of transformation or arrangement to create the output.",
    "hints": [
      "Consider using a loop to iterate over the input grid and select elements based on certain conditions.",
      "Mathematically, the transformation could be represented as a function that takes the input grid as an argument and returns the output grid.",
      "üîçÔ∏è Examine the input grid carefully to identify any patterns or structures that could be used to derive the output grid."
