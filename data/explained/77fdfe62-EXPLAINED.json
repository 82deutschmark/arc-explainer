In the bottom-right block, I noticed the output is 0, but the outer corner value is 3. \n\nIt seems the pattern leans toward picking unique, special numbers located on the perimeter of the blocks, while bordered by 1s. The corners of the input match nicely to the outputs I’m generating."

Now, looking at Ex2, the input is an 8x8 matrix that divides into 4 blocks, each measuring 2x2. This makes sense since 8 divided by 4 equals 2. \n\nThe input is structured with 1s forming grid lines, and the corners of the outer frame show values at the border positions: 2 at the top-left, 3 at the top-right, 4 at the bottom-left, and 6 at the bottom-right. \n\nI'll need to deduce the mapping from the 8x8 input, focusing on how the blocks relate to the 4x4 output."

The outer corners of the input matrix are key numbers, specifically 2, 3, 4, and 6. \n\nI hypothesize the original grid is an 8x8 with 1s forming separators. The output 4x4 seems to represent the proximity of corner numbers within specific quadrants. I’ll review the positions of 8s in Ex2, as they might help define connections to each corner number, guiding how to compute the output values based on their nearest corner. Let's clarify which approach yields the best mapping to the outputs!"

To create a 4x4 output from this 8x8 setup, I think of removing rows and columns of all ones to compress it into a smaller grid. \n\nI note that outputs could correspond to 2x2 blocks, showing which corner number affects each output cell, depending on the nearest clusters of 8. Let’s see how patterns in Ex3 help decode this further!"

The corner number in block (0,0) should propagate its value if there’s a clear path to the center of the block. For example, in Ex2, the top-left corner numbered 2 should carry into neighboring blocks until it hits an 8, but interestingly, the output there is 0 instead.\n\nI’m noticing a potential pattern concerning how separators affect output sizes based on row configurations, suggesting a formula: the output size equals the number of non-all-one rows minus two.

If it’s zero, it stays zero in the output, and if it’s an 8, it takes the nearest corner number instead. This mapping should align well with the previous outputs — let’s see how that plays out!"
