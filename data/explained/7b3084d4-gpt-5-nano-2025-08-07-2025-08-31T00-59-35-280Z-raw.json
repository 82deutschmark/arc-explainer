  "solvingStrategy": "I analyzed the provided training examples to infer the transformation from the input grid to the output grid. Each example features multiple colored regions on a mostly zero background. The outputs appear to consolidate information about these regions into a smaller, structured mosaic where colors are mapped to new labels and arranged in a compact grid. Although the exact mapping rules can be complex (and seem to ignore the original color values in favor of consistent region labeling and spatial arrangement), the common pattern across examples is that the output encodes the relative placement and grouping of the colored regions in a smaller rectangular grid, using a fixed set of color labels that likely correspond to distinct regions from the input. For the test case, I apply a plausible extension of this pattern: identify major colored regions (2, 3, 7), and produce a compact 6x6 mosaic where each region occupies a block-like region in a uniform arrangement. This is a best-guess reconstruction based on the observed trend of turning multi-color regions into a structured, simplified mosaic in the output.",
  "keySteps": [
    "Step 1: Inspect training examples to identify commonalities in input -> output mappings. All training inputs have multiple colored clusters on a zero background and outputs present as smaller, organized mosaics with distinct color labels.",
    "Step 2: Hypothesize that output represents a condensed, labeled map of the input regions, where each connected region is assigned a color in the output grid, and the layout reflects the spatial arrangement of regions in a compact form.",
    "Step 3: Determine a reasonable 6x6 (or similar) mosaic for the test case that respects the presence and grouping of colors 2, 3, and 7, producing a simple, structured block layout in the output.",
    "Step 4: Provide a concrete 6x6 grid that encodes the three color regions in a balanced, grid-aligned pattern. This is a best-effort approximation given the limited ability to deduce exact mapping rules from the examples alone.",
    "Note: Without an unambiguous rule set, this prediction follows the general trend of producing a structured mosaic that conveys region grouping rather than a literal color carryover."

  "patternDescription": "Transform multi-region input into a compact, labeled mosaic. Distinct colored regions in the input are represented as blocks in the output grid, using a fixed set of color labels. The spatial arrangement and relative grouping of regions are preserved in a condensed form.",
  "hints": [
    "Best algorithm (pseudo-code):",
    "1) Detect connected components by color (ignoring 0). Group by color labels.",
    "2) Determine a bounding box for each component and map to a standardized small grid, preserving relative positions.",
    "3) Fill a new grid with a balanced arrangement of the region labels to reflect the input structure.",

    "Math-like approach (also considered): Use matrix operations to compress the high-resolution grid by aggregating blocks corresponding to detected regions and assigning new numeric labels.",
    "",
    "Emojis approach (imagery): Represent each region with a unique emoji color tag and place them in a grid that mirrors their spatial relationships (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering)."
