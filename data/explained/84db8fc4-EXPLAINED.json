I think the rule might involve determining if a zero path leftwards hits a boundary or a non-zero. For example, in row 3 column 3, there’s a zero leading to a 5, and exploring its neighbors reveals a mix of zeros and non-zeros. There’s a pattern based on whether zero components touch the grid's border—this could classify them as enclosed or part of the background. In this context, treating zeros as background may turn them into a different value."

I realize that even if there's a path to the border, they might not connect properly due to other zeros. The rule seems to be: if zeros connect to the grid border, they turn to 2; otherwise, they change to 5. \n\nAfter checking various rows and their connections, I find that row 2 column 9’s zero is not connected to any border component, so it turns to 2. It’s blocked by a 3, making full connectivity difficult."

For instance, in row 2 column 9, I see connections going down to row 5 column 9, but then it stops due to a barrier. So, row 4 column 9 remains isolated.\n\nThis suggests I might need to look at the rules for zero classifications. In Example 1, zeros might be converted to 5 if they’re enclosed without connecting to the border. I’ll then check how zeros in subsequent examples transform, particularly focusing on their adjacency to border components. \n\nI find that zeros usually change to 2 if they're connected to the border and become 5 if they're enclosed. I'll analyze the coordinates of zeros for connectivity and clarify each zero's classification in the broader context."

Starting with component A, I will process the zeros using breadth-first search (BFS) and focus on connecting neighbors. For instance, from the starting point at (0,1), I'll explore neighboring positions and identify which zeros are connected. \n\nAfter mapping out connections, I observe that some zeros become isolated, indicating new components are formed. Moving on, I also check for connections along the border and examine other potential components, ensuring I mark all visited zeros. There may be deeper internal zeros connected that I've yet to process, which I plan to revisit for clarity."
