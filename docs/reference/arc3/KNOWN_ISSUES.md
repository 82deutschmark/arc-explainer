# Known Issues and Implementation Status for ARC3 Agent Playground

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** STREAMING FIXED - Arc3StreamService + Arc3RealGameRunner (OpenAI Agents SDK); OpenRouter handled via dedicated arc3-openrouter stack
**Strategy:** Single primary implementation using Arc3RealGameRunner (OpenAI Agents SDK); OpenRouter path uses Arc3OpenRouter* services/python bridge
**Session Notes:** Critical streaming bug fixed - frontend now targets `/api/arc3` routes; cancel path corrected

---

## Current Architecture

Primary runner: **Arc3RealGameRunner** (OpenAI Agents SDK) via `/api/arc3` + `Arc3StreamService`.

OpenRouter path: dedicated stack (`/api/arc3-openrouter`, Arc3OpenRouter* services + python bridge) with matching event model.

Reference: Claude SDK (external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/) and ARC-AGI-3-Agents2 (external).

### The Pattern (from Claude SDK)

All three implementations follow this flow:
1. `openScorecard()` → Get `card_id` from `/api/scorecard/open`
2. `startGame(game_id, card_id)` → Call `/api/cmd/RESET` → Get `guid` + initial frame
3. **Loop:**
   - Call LLM provider (Responses API) with current frame + available actions as tools
   - Parse action tool call from LLM response
   - Execute action via `/api/cmd/ACTION{1-6}` with `guid` + `card_id`
   - Get new frame + state
4. Repeat until `state === 'WIN'` or `state === 'GAME_OVER'`

**Key insight:** This is lightweight because we're NOT using heavy SDKs. We're making simple HTTP calls and asking the LLM to pick actions via tool calls.

---

## Issues & Status

### ✅ RESOLVED
- **Claude SDK Integration:** Moved from `.cache/external/` to `external/` as proper git submodule
- **Frontend Provider Naming:** Updated to `openai_nano` and `openai_codex` (clear labeling)
- **Claude SDK Reference:** Available at `external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/` with full pattern documentation

### ✅ FIXED (2026-01-02 to 2026-01-03)
- Frontend hook now targets `/api/arc3` prepare/stream/cancel and matches cancel path.
- Cancel endpoint path mismatch corrected (`/stream/cancel/:sessionId`).
- Action set includes ACTION7; available_actions normalized server-side.
- Streaming animation frames unpacked and emitted (frameUnpacker).
- OpenRouter page uses dedicated routes/bridge; event model aligned with frontend.

### ⏳ TODO
- Optional: Port analysis helpers from Claude SDK (frame/grid analysis) into TS runner for richer reasoning.
- Decide fate of legacy runners (Arc3OpenAIRunner, CodexArc3Runner) — keep as reference or remove.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT Wire Arc3OpenAI Routes
The previous audit recommended registering `arc3OpenAI` routes. **DO NOT DO THIS** without fixing event types first.

**Problem:** Arc3OpenAIRunner emits different SSE events than the frontend expects:
| Frontend Expects | Arc3OpenAIRunner Emits |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `agent.starting`, `agent.ready` | (missing) |
| `agent.tool_call`, `agent.tool_result` | (missing) |
| `agent.reasoning`, `agent.reasoning_complete` | (missing) |
| `game.action_executed` | `game.action_start`, `game.action_result` |

**If you wire these routes:** The frontend will silently fail to update the UI because it's listening for events that never arrive.

**Current working solution:** Use `/api/arc3` routes which use `Arc3RealGameRunner` + `Arc3StreamService` - this emits all the events the frontend expects.

### ❌ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (By Design)
- Multi-turn continuation: supported via SSE session continuation with `previousResponseId`; keep cache TTL in mind.

---

## OpenRouter Implementation Strategy (CRITICAL CLARIFICATION)

### The Problem with Arc3OpenAIRunner Pattern
The previous developer created Arc3OpenAIRunner, and the audit recommended copying it for OpenRouter. **This is incorrect and will NOT work.**

**Why?** Event type mismatch:

| Runner | Events Emitted | Frontend Receives | Result |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Arc3RealGameRunner** | `agent.starting`, `agent.ready`, `agent.tool_call`, `agent.tool_result`, `agent.reasoning`, `agent.reasoning_complete` | ✅ All UI updates work | ✅ WORKS PERFECTLY |
| **Arc3OpenAIRunner** | `stream.init`, `game.action_start`, `game.action_result` | ❌ Missing all agent events | ❌ SILENT FAILURE |
| **Arc3OpenRouter (if copied)** | `stream.init`, `game.action_start`, `game.action_result` | ❌ Missing all agent events | ❌ SILENT FAILURE |

**Solution:** Arc3OpenRouterRunner must emit the SAME event types as Arc3RealGameRunner.

### Recommended Implementation (Two Options)

#### Option A: Refactor Arc3OpenAIRunner (Best Long-Term)
1. Fix Arc3OpenAIRunner to emit the correct events
2. Copy Arc3OpenAIRunner pattern for Arc3OpenRouterRunner
3. Benefits: Lightweight HTTP-based runners, no SDK dependency
4. Effort: 4-5 hours

**Correct event sequence for Arc3OpenAIRunner should be:**
```typescript
// Before loop
stream.emitEvent("agent.starting", { ... });

// In loop before action
stream.emitEvent("agent.tool_call", { tool: "ACTION1", ... });

// After action executes
stream.emitEvent("agent.tool_result", { tool: "ACTION1", ... });

// After getting new frame
stream.emitEvent("game.frame_update", { frame, turn });

// At end
stream.emitEvent("agent.completed", { ... });
```

#### Option B: Leverage Arc3RealGameRunner (Current Recommendation)
1. Arc3RealGameRunner already works perfectly with OpenAI Agents SDK
2. The Agents SDK already handles tool calls, reasoning, streaming
3. OpenRouter doesn't have an Agents SDK equivalent
4. **Use the lightweight HTTP approach** (similar to what Python agents do)

**Current state:** Arc3RealGameRunner works, so streaming already works! No urgent need for OpenRouter yet.

### Why Streaming Already Works (Right Now!)
1. Frontend calls `/api/arc3/stream/prepare`
2. Backend uses Arc3RealGameRunner + OpenAI Agents SDK
3. All events are correct ✅
4. No urgent need for OpenRouter alternative

### When You Add OpenRouter Support
**Only create Arc3OpenRouterRunner when:**
- Users request OpenRouter provider as alternative
- You ensure it emits the same events as Arc3RealGameRunner
- You test the UI updates work correctly

**Key difference from Arc3RealGameRunner:**
- Arc3RealGameRunner: Uses OpenAI Agents SDK (has built-in streaming/reasoning)
- Arc3OpenRouterRunner: Direct Chat Completions API (like Python agents do)

## Reference Implementations

Two reference repos exist to guide implementation:

1. **Claude SDK** (Official Claude Code Implementation)
   - Location: `external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/`
   - Provides: CLI scripts showing exact HTTP request patterns
   - Pattern: Read `CLAUDE.MD` for system instructions
   - Usage: Direct reference for action/scorecard APIs

2. **ARC-AGI-3-Agents2** (Official Agents Reference)
   - Location: `external/ARC-AGI-3-Agents2/` ✅ Added as submodule 2026-01-02
   - Provides: Python implementations, official API examples, random agent, LangGraph agents
   - Usage: Cross-reference for API contract validation
   - Key files: `agents/random.py`, `agents/agent.py`, `main.py`

---

## How to Use Each Runner

### Claude SDK (Manual/Interactive)
```bash
node external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/actions/open-scorecard.js
node external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/actions/start-game.js --game ls20
node external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/actions/action.js --type 1
```

### OpenAI Runner (Via Web UI)
```
1. Open http://localhost:5173/arc3-agent-playground
2. Select "OpenAI Nano" from provider dropdown
3. Select game, click "Start Agent"
4. Watch SSE stream with frames + reasoning
```

### OpenRouter Runner (Via Web UI) - Coming Soon
```
1. Open http://localhost:5173/arc3-agent-playground
2. Select "OpenRouter" from provider dropdown
3. (Same workflow as OpenAI)
```

---

## What This Means Going Forward

### Do This ✅
- Use **Claude SDK** as the reference pattern for HTTP calls and scorecard lifecycle
- Create new runners by copying the Arc3OpenAIRunner pattern
- Keep each runner focused: one provider, one clear implementation
- Test each runner independently before toggling between them

### Don't Do This ❌
- Extend Arc3RealGameRunner or CodexArc3Runner (deprecated Agents SDK approach)
- Create new documentation before implementing (focus on code)
- Mix multiple providers in a single runner
- Add complexity beyond the three-step HTTP pattern

---

## Quick Audit Summary

**What Works:**
- Claude SDK reference implementation (fully functional)
- Arc3OpenAIRunner code exists (just needs route registration)
- Frontend provider selection UI exists

**What's Broken:**
- Arc3OpenAIRunner routes not registered → endpoints don't respond
- No OpenRouter implementation yet

**What's Missing:**
- Arc3OpenRouterRunner implementation
- Route registration for Arc3OpenAIRunner
- Helper utilities from Claude SDK

**Time to Full Implementation:**
- Wire up Arc3OpenAI routes: **30 min**
- Create Arc3OpenRouter runner: **2-3 hours**
- Add helper utilities: **1-2 days** (optional, improves agent quality)
- Testing & cleanup: **1 day**

**Total: ~1 week for three working, parallel implementations**

## For the Next Developer: Detailed Implementation Guide

### What Was Done (2026-01-02)

**Morning Session (Audit):**
1. ✅ **Comprehensive Audit** - Identified complexity in existing implementation
2. ✅ **Claude SDK Integration** - Moved from `.cache/external/` to `external/` as proper submodule
3. ✅ **ARC-AGI-3-Agents2 Added** - Added official Python agents repo as submodule for reference
4. ✅ **Documentation** - Created comprehensive audit trail and reference docs
5. ✅ **Arc3OpenAIRunner Created** - Lightweight runner (but NOT needed - see warning above)

**Evening Session (Critical Fix by Cascade):**
6. ✅ **STREAMING BUG FIXED** - Frontend was calling `/api/arc3-openai` which was never registered
   - Changed `useArc3AgentStream.ts` line 136-138: `/api/arc3-openai` → `/api/arc3`
   - Fixed cancel endpoint path: `/stream/:sessionId/cancel` → `/stream/cancel/:sessionId`
7. ✅ **Root Cause Identified** - Arc3OpenAI routes should NOT be wired due to event type mismatch
8. ✅ **Build Verified** - `npm run build` passes successfully

### What You Need to Do Next

#### ✅ STREAMING IS ALREADY WORKING!

**STATUS: NOTHING TO DO** - The streaming now works perfectly via existing `/api/arc3` routes.

**Current architecture (complete and functional):**
- Frontend: `useArc3AgentStream.ts` → `/api/arc3/*` routes (FIXED)
- Backend: `Arc3StreamService.ts` + `Arc3RealGameRunner.ts` (OpenAI Agents SDK)
- Event types: All correct ✅
- Database persistence: Complete ✅
- Frame caching: Working ✅
- Multi-turn continuation: Working ✅

**Verify it works:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173/arc3-agent-playground
# Select a game, enter instructions, click "Start Agent"
# You should see SSE events flowing, frames updating, reasoning visible
```

**What was needed and fixed (2026-01-02):**
- ✅ Fixed frontend hook to use correct `/api/arc3` routes (not `/api/arc3-openai`)
- ✅ Fixed cancel endpoint path mismatch
- ✅ Build passes successfully

**No further work needed on streaming. The system works!**

#### STEP 2: (Optional) Create Arc3OpenRouter Runner - NOT URGENT

**IMPORTANT:** Streaming already works via `/api/arc3` routes using Arc3RealGameRunner!

**Skip this step unless:**
- Users specifically request OpenRouter support
- You want to offer lightweight HTTP runners as alternative to Agents SDK

**If you decide to implement OpenRouter:**

Choose one of these approaches:

**Approach A: Fix Arc3OpenAIRunner First (Recommended Long-Term)**
1. Update Arc3OpenAIRunner to emit correct events (see section above)
2. Then copy Arc3OpenAIRunner pattern for Arc3OpenRouterRunner
3. Benefits: Clean, lightweight HTTP-based runners
4. Effort: 4-5 hours

**Approach B: Minimal HTTP Implementation (Like Python Agents)**
1. Create lightweight Arc3OpenRouterRunner (simpler than Arc3OpenAIRunner)
2. Direct HTTP calls to OpenRouter Chat Completions API
3. Emit the same events as Arc3RealGameRunner
4. No stream service needed (keep it simple)
5. Effort: 2-3 hours

**OpenRouter API Reference:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'HTTP-Referer': 'https://arc-explainer.com',  // Required
    'X-Title': 'ARC Explainer',  // Required
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: config.model,  // e.g., 'openai/gpt-4o-mini'
    messages: [ { role: 'user', content: ... } ],
    tools: [ /* ACTION definitions */ ],
    tool_choice: 'auto',
    stream: true,  // For streaming
  })
});
```

**Critical Requirement:**
- Must emit these events (minimum):
  ```
  agent.starting → agent.tool_call → agent.tool_result → game.frame_update → agent.completed
  ```
- Use the same pattern as Arc3RealGameRunner event emission

#### STEP 3: Update Frontend Provider Selection (30 minutes)

**Files to modify:**

1. **`client/src/hooks/useArc3AgentStream.ts`**
   - Add `openrouter` case to provider routing logic
   - Around line 136, add:
     ```typescript
     const apiBasePath =
       options.provider === 'openrouter' ? '/api/arc3-openrouter' :
       options.provider === 'openai_nano' || options.provider === 'openai_codex' ? '/api/arc3-openai' :
       '/api/arc3';  // fallback to old Agents SDK runner
     ```

2. **`client/src/pages/ARC3AgentPlayground.tsx`**
   - Update provider state type to include openrouter:
     ```typescript
     const [provider, setProvider] = useState<'openai_nano' | 'openai_codex' | 'openrouter'>('openai_nano');
     ```
   - Add "OpenRouter" option to provider selection UI

3. **`shared/types.ts`**
   - Update `Arc3AgentOptions.provider` type to include `'openrouter'`

#### STEP 4: Test All Three Implementations

**Testing checklist:**

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Test Claude SDK (manual, CLI)
cd external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK
node actions/list-games.js
node actions/open-scorecard.js
node actions/start-game.js --game ls20
node actions/action.js --type 1

# 3. Test OpenAI Runner (web UI)
# Open http://localhost:5173/arc3-agent-playground
# Select "OpenAI Nano" from dropdown
# Select game "ls20"
# Click "Start Agent"
# Verify: SSE stream shows frames, reasoning, actions

# 4. Test OpenRouter Runner (web UI)
# Same as OpenAI but select "OpenRouter" from dropdown
# Verify: Works with OpenRouter API key

# 5. Verify health endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/arc3-openai/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/arc3-openrouter/health
```

**Expected results:**
- All three providers work independently
- Frontend can toggle between them
- SSE streaming shows frames updating in real-time
- Game completes with WIN or GAME_OVER state

## Reference Code Patterns

### Claude SDK Pattern (Reference)
```javascript
// From external/ARC-AGI-3-ClaudeCode-SDK/actions/start-game.js
const response = await makeRequest("/api/cmd/RESET", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    game_id: options.game,
    card_id: config.currentScorecardId,
  }),
});
// Response: { guid, frame, state, score, win_score }
```

### Arc3OpenAIRunner Pattern (Ours)
```typescript
// From server/services/arc3/Arc3OpenAIRunner.ts:52-53
const cardId = await this.apiClient.openScorecard(["openai-runner"], "arc-explainer");
let frame = await this.apiClient.startGame(config.game_id, undefined, cardId);

// Loop pattern (line 60-92)
for (; turn < maxTurns; turn++) {
  if (frame.state === "WIN" || frame.state === "GAME_OVER") break;

  const action = await this.chooseAction(apiKey, config.model, frame, ...);
  frame = await this.apiClient.executeAction(config.game_id, frame.guid, { action: action.type, ... }, undefined, cardId);

  stream.emitEvent("game.frame_update", { frame, turn: turn + 1 });
}
```

### Tool Calls Format (OpenAI/OpenRouter)
```typescript
// Tools definition (what LLM sees)
const tools = [
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "ACTION1",
      description: "Move up or perform primary action",
      parameters: { type: "object", properties: {} }
    }
  },
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "ACTION6",
      description: "Click at specific coordinates",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          x: { type: "integer", minimum: 0, maximum: 63 },
          y: { type: "integer", minimum: 0, maximum: 63 }
        },
        required: ["x", "y"]
      }
    }
  }
];

// LLM response parsing
const toolCall = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0];
const actionType = toolCall.function.name;  // "ACTION1" or "ACTION6"
const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);  // { x: 10, y: 20 } for ACTION6
```

---

## Gotchas & Common Issues

### 1. Route Registration Order Matters
Routes MUST be registered in `server/routes.ts` or they won't respond. Check with:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/arc3-openai/health
# If 404 → routes not registered
```

### 2. OpenRouter Headers Required
OpenRouter requires these headers or requests fail:
```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  'HTTP-Referer': 'https://your-site.com',  // Required
  'X-Title': 'Your App Name'  // Required
}
```

### 3. SSE Registration Must Happen Before Streaming
```typescript
// CORRECT order:
sseStreamManager.register(sessionId, res);
res.flushHeaders();  // Send headers to client
await startStreaming(sessionId);  // Start sending events

// WRONG (events lost):
await startStreaming(sessionId);
sseStreamManager.register(sessionId, res);
```

### 4. Arc3ApiClient Requires card_id AND guid
```typescript
// WRONG:
await apiClient.executeAction(gameId, guid, { action: 'ACTION1' });

// CORRECT:
await apiClient.executeAction(gameId, guid, { action: 'ACTION1' }, undefined, cardId);
//                                                                    ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^
//                                                                    reasoning  card_id
```

### 5. Frame State Transitions
```typescript
// Initial RESET call:
frame.state === "NOT_FINISHED"  // or "NOT_PLAYED"

// After actions:
frame.state === "NOT_FINISHED"  // game continues
frame.state === "WIN"           // level/game won
frame.state === "GAME_OVER"     // failed (health=0, max actions reached, etc.)
```
