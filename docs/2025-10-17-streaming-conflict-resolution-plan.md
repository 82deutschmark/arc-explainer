# 2025-10-17 Streaming Conflict Resolution Plan

## Context
- Follow-up on pending-session handshake work after upstream updates.
- Ensure service imports compile cleanly and the branch merges without conflicts.

## Tasks
1. Inspect streaming service for misplaced code introduced by merge (e.g., constants before imports) and align with module ordering expectations.
2. Re-run lightweight static checks (lint or type-aware tooling, if available) to confirm no residual TypeScript errors surface from the reordering.
3. Verify git status for cleanliness and prepare documentation of resolution steps for reviewers.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **ESM ordering mistakes**: run TypeScript compiler or lint to surface syntax issues early.
- **Untracked edits**: monitor `git status` after each change.

## Exit Criteria
- No module-level ordering violations remain.
- Streaming service builds without syntax/import errors.
- Branch ready for re-review with documented plan.
