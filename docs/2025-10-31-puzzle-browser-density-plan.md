# 2025-10-31 Puzzle Browser Density Plan

## Goal
Refresh the Puzzle Browser hero and filters to feel neutral, information dense, and properly aligned while removing the purple gradient theme.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update `client/src/pages/PuzzleBrowser.tsx` layout wrappers to use a centered max-width container with neutral background colors.
- [ ] Rebuild the hero section with compact summary metrics and quick-link lists that fit inside a tidy grid.
- [ ] Tighten filter controls into an aligned grid, remove gradient buttons, and ensure search aligns with filter selects.
- [ ] Adjust results and instructional cards to match the neutral styling and spacing.
- [ ] Verify derived puzzle counts and active filter indicators still render correctly after refactors.
- [ ] Capture responsive behavior at common breakpoints (mobile, md, lg) manually after code changes.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a note about the new neutral, denser Puzzle Browser styling.
