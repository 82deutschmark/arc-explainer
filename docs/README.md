## Reference material (`docs/reference/`)

- `api/` – External and internal API contracts, streaming guides, and integration notes.
- `architecture/` – System-wide architecture, schema alignment, and developer onboarding references.
- `data/` – Data extracts and schema investigations.
- `frontend/` – Frontend hook usage guides.
- `solvers/` – Deep dives on Python/solver implementations.

## Archived work (`docs/oldPlans/`)

Historical plans (older than 7 days) now live under `docs/oldPlans/`. Recent archival batches are grouped by month, e.g.:

- `docs/oldPlans/2025-10/` – Early October 2025 responses API, Grover, and documentation clean-up efforts.
- `docs/oldPlans/2025-02/` – February 2025 puzzle browser refresh plans.

Older summer plans remain in the root of `docs/oldPlans/` and can be further organized if needed.
