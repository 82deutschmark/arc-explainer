# ARC Explainer Developer Onboarding Guide

*Last Updated: September 16, 2025*

Welcome to the ARC Explainer project! This guide is designed to help new developers understand the project's architecture, locate key files, and contribute effectively. Our goal is to reuse existing components and maintain a clear, modular structure.

## Project Overview

The ARC Explainer is a full-stack web application for analyzing and visualizing Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) puzzles. It allows users to submit puzzles to various AI models, view their analyses, and compare results. The application is built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, following a "database-first" architecture.

### Core Philosophy: Database-First Architecture

The application's data flow is designed to ensure data integrity and persistence. Hereâ€™s the typical flow for an analysis request:

1.  **Frontend Request**: The user initiates an action (e.g., clicking "Analyze") in the UI.
2.  **Backend Processing**: The backend receives the request, constructs a prompt, calls an external AI service, validates the response, and saves the complete, validated result to the PostgreSQL database.
3.  **Frontend Refetch**: After the backend confirms the database write, the frontend re-fetches the data from the database to update the UI.

This ensures that the UI always displays a persistent, validated record. For a detailed trace, see [Analysis Data Flow Trace](./Analysis_Data_Flow_Trace.md).

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into three main parts: `client`, `server`, and `shared`.

### `client/` - The Frontend

The frontend is a React application built with Vite. All source code resides in `client/src/`.

-   **`pages/`**: Top-level components that correspond to a specific URL route (e.g., `PuzzleExaminer.tsx`). These components assemble layouts and are responsible for page-level concerns.
-   **`components/`**: Reusable UI elements. This directory is further organized by feature (e.g., `puzzle/`, `overview/`) and common UI elements (`ui/`). Before creating a new component, always check here first.
-   **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks that encapsulate business logic and data fetching (e.g., `usePuzzle.ts`, `useAnalysisResults.ts`). Hooks are the primary way the frontend interacts with the backend API.
-   **`contexts/`**: React context providers for managing global or shared state across the application (e.g., `AnalysisContext.tsx`).
-   **`lib/`**: Utility functions, query client configuration, and other shared frontend logic.

### `server/` - The Backend

The backend is a Node.js application using Express.js.

-   **`controllers/`**: These handle incoming HTTP requests, orchestrate the necessary business logic, and send back responses. They act as the bridge between the client and the backend services (e.g., `puzzleController.ts`).
-   **`services/`**: This is where the core business logic lives. Services are responsible for tasks like calling external AI APIs (`openai.ts`, `gemini.ts`), building prompts (`promptBuilder.ts`), and validating responses (`responseValidator.ts`).
-   **`repositories/`**: These classes are responsible for all database interactions. They contain the raw SQL queries and logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (e.g., `ExplanationRepository.ts`, `AccuracyRepository.ts`). No other part of the application should interact with the database directly.
-   **`routes/`**: Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the appropriate controller functions.
-   **`utils/`**: Shared utility functions for the backend, such as logging and response formatting.

### `shared/` - Code for Both Client and Server

This directory contains code that is used by both the frontend and the backend.

-   **`types.ts`**: Contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces (e.g., `ARCTask`, `AnalysisResult`) shared across the entire application to ensure type safety.

## Key Component Reference

This section provides a quick reference to the most important files in the project. Before starting a new task, review these files to see if the functionality you need already exists.

### Server-Side Components

| Directory | File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `controllers` | `puzzleController.ts` | Orchestrates all puzzle-related operations, including analysis, fetching, and stats. |
| | `batchAnalysisController.ts` | Handles starting, pausing, and monitoring batch analysis sessions. |
| | `eloController.ts` | Manages ELO rating calculations and leaderboards for models. |
| `services` | `puzzleAnalysisService.ts` | Core logic for analyzing a single puzzle, including prompt building and validation. |
| | `explanationService.ts` | Handles the saving and processing of AI-generated explanations. |
| | `aiServiceFactory.ts` | A factory that returns the correct AI provider service (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini) based on a model key. |
| | `pythonBridge.ts` | Manages communication with Python scripts for specialized solvers. |
| `repositories`| `ExplanationRepository.ts` | All database operations for the `explanations` table. |
| | `AccuracyRepository.ts` | Queries for calculating and retrieving model accuracy statistics. |
| | `EloRepository.ts` | Database logic for storing and updating ELO scores. |

### Client-Side Components

| Directory | File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pages` | `PuzzleExaminer.tsx` | The main page for viewing a puzzle, triggering analysis, and displaying results. |
| | `PuzzleBrowser.tsx` | The primary dashboard for browsing and filtering all puzzles. |
| | `EloLeaderboard.tsx` | Displays the ELO rankings of all AI models. |
| `components` | `PuzzleViewer.tsx` | A core component that displays the training and test grids for a puzzle. |
| | `AnalysisResultCard.tsx`| Renders a single AI model's explanation for a puzzle. |
| | `ModelButton.tsx` | A specialized button for triggering an analysis with a specific model. |
| `hooks` | `usePuzzle.ts` | Fetches and manages the state for a single puzzle. |
| | `useAnalysisResults.ts`| Manages the state and logic for running analyses and handling results. |
| | `useExplanation.ts` | Fetches existing explanations for a puzzle from the database. |
| `contexts` | `AnalysisContext.tsx` | Provides shared state for analysis operations across different components. |

By familiarizing yourself with this structure, you can quickly identify where to find existing logic and where to add new features, ensuring that we continue to build upon the solid foundation of the ARC Explainer.
