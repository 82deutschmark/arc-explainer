# Grover WebSocket Broadcasting Fix

**Issue:** Frontend UI not receiving backend logs during Grover analysis  

---

## Problem

The backend terminal showed rich logs during Grover analysis:
```
[Grover] 🚀 Starting Grover analysis...
[Grover] 🔁 Iteration 2/5
[Grover] 📖 Parsing 1234 characters of response text...
[Grover] ✅ Found program #1 (707 chars, 23 lines)
[Grover] 📊 Extraction complete: 3 program(s) found
```

But the **frontend UI saw NOTHING** - the LiveActivityStream component was empty.

---

## Root Cause

`server/services/grover.ts` was importing from the **wrong logger**:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This logger doesn't broadcast to WebSocket
import { logger } from "../utils/logger.js";
```

The correct import should be:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - This logger auto-broadcasts via AsyncLocalStorage
import { logger } from "../utils/broadcastLogger.js";
```

### Why This Matters

The `broadcastLogger.ts` utility:
1. Wraps the standard logger
2. Uses `AsyncLocalStorage` to track session context across async operations
3. **Automatically broadcasts ALL logs to WebSocket** when session context is set
4. Is already being used by `groverController.ts` via `setSessionContext()`

The controller was correctly setting up the session context:
```typescript
// groverController.ts line 47
setSessionContext(sessionId, async () => {
  const result = await groverService.analyzePuzzleWithModel(...);
});
```

But because `grover.ts` was using the base logger instead of broadcastLogger, the logs never made it to the WebSocket.

---

## The Fix

### 1. Changed Import in `grover.ts`
```typescript
// Before
import { logger, type LogLevel } from "../utils/logger.js";

// After
import { logger, type LogLevel } from "../utils/broadcastLogger.js";
```

### 2. Simplified `log()` Wrapper
The manual broadcast logic was no longer needed:

```typescript
// Before - Manual broadcast
const log = (message: string, level: LogLevel = 'info') => {
  logger.service(this.provider, message, level);
  if (sessionId) {
    try {
      broadcast(sessionId, {
        status: 'running',
        phase: 'log',
        message,
        level,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
    } catch {}
  }
};

// After - Auto-broadcast via AsyncLocalStorage
const log = (message: string, level: LogLevel = 'info') => {
  logger.service(this.provider, message, level);
};
```

### 3. Reverted `extractPrograms()` Changes
No longer needed to pass `log()` as a parameter:

```typescript
// Before
private extractPrograms(response: AIResponse, log: (msg: string, level?: LogLevel) => void): string[]

// After
private extractPrograms(response: AIResponse): string[]
```

All `logger.service()` calls in `extractPrograms()` now automatically broadcast to WebSocket.

### 4. Exported `LogLevel` Type from `broadcastLogger.ts`
```typescript
// Re-export LogLevel for consumers
export type { LogLevel };
```

## Impact

✅ **Frontend now receives ALL backend logs in real-time:**
- "📖 Parsing X characters of response text..."
- "✅ Found program #1 (707 chars, 23 lines)"
- "📊 Extraction complete: 3 program(s) found"
- All warnings and errors

✅ **No code duplication** - Uses existing `broadcastLogger` infrastructure

✅ **Cleaner architecture** - No manual broadcast logic scattered throughout service

✅ **Consistent with other services** - Saturn Visual Solver already uses this pattern

## Files Modified

1. **`server/services/grover.ts`**
   - Changed import from `logger.js` to `broadcastLogger.js`
   - Simplified `log()` wrapper function
   - Reverted `extractPrograms()` signature (no longer needs log parameter)

2. **`server/utils/broadcastLogger.ts`**
   - Added `export type { LogLevel }` for TypeScript consumers

---

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Grover Solver page
3. Select a puzzle and model
4. Click "Start Analysis"
5. Watch the LiveActivityStream component - should now show:
   - Iteration progress
   - Program extraction logs
   - Execution results
   - All backend activity in real-time

## Related Code

- **Controller:** `server/controllers/groverController.ts` (already using `setSessionContext`)
- **WebSocket Service:** `server/services/wsService.ts`
- **Broadcast Logger:** `server/utils/broadcastLogger.ts` (AsyncLocalStorage magic)
- **Frontend Hook:** `client/src/hooks/useGroverProgress.ts`
- **Frontend UI:** `client/src/components/grover/LiveActivityStream.tsx`

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check which logger is being imported** - `logger.js` vs `broadcastLogger.js`
2. **AsyncLocalStorage is powerful** - Maintains context across async operations without manual passing
3. **Don't reinvent the wheel** - The `broadcastLogger` utility already existed and solved this problem
4. **Follow existing patterns** - Other services (Saturn) were already using this correctly

---

## SRP/DRY Check: ✅ Pass
- Single responsibility: Grover focuses on iterative solving, delegates logging to broadcastLogger
- DRY: Reuses existing broadcastLogger infrastructure, no duplicate broadcast logic

## shadcn/ui: ✅ Pass
- Backend service changes only, no UI components modified
