# 2025-12-31 AGENTS vs CLAUDE Alignment Plan

## Objective
Ensure `AGENTS.md` mirrors every instruction presently documented in `CLAUDE.md` so contributors can rely on either file without missing guidance.

## Scope
- Compare both files end-to-end (table of contents, sections, warnings, appendices).
- Port any CLAUDE-exclusive sections, bullet points, or nuances into `AGENTS.md` while preserving its existing structure and additional detail.
- Keep wording synchronized where possible so future diffs stay small.

## Tasks
1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Read both files completely and note sections or directives only present in `CLAUDE.md`.
   - Decide whether to merge wording or add new sections/subsections inside `AGENTS.md`.
2. **File Update**
   - Edit `AGENTS.md` so every instruction from `CLAUDE.md` is represented (table of contents, architecture quick reference, scoring appendix, common issues, etc.).
   - Maintain existing AGENTS-specific material; just augment or reorganize as needed.
3. **Validation**
   - Re-read both files to confirm parity.
   - Summarize key deltas for the user and note any intentional differences (if any remain).
