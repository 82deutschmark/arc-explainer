 🔍 Deep Analysis of Systemic Problems

    After analyzing the complex failure patterns, I've identified 5 interconnected issue categories        
    that require coordinated solutions:

    Issue Category 1: OpenRouter Continuation API Format (CRITICAL)

    Root Cause: My continuation payload is fundamentally wrong
    - Current Issue: Including both messages AND continue parameters
    - API Error: "400 Input required: specify prompt or messages"
    - Hypothesis: Continuation API expects EITHER messages OR continue, not both
    - Research Needed: Determine correct OpenRouter continuation format

    Issue Category 2: Provider-Level Failures (SYSTEMATIC)

    Empty Response Pattern: HTTP 200 + finish_reason: stop + 0 chars
    - openai/gpt-oss-120b (DeepInfra provider)
    - z-ai/glm-4.5 (Z.AI provider error 524)
    - Root Cause: Provider infrastructure issues, not client errors
    - Impact: 20-30% of models failing consistently

    Issue Category 3: JSON Truncation Detection Gaps (PARSING)

    New Pattern: "Unexpected end of JSON input"
    - x-ai/grok-4, qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507
    - Root Cause: Responses truncated during transmission, not caught by finish_reason
    - Missing: Network-level truncation detection

    Issue Category 4: Data Pipeline Breaks (FRONTEND)

    User Report: reasoningItems: undefined, hasReasoningLog: falseBackend Success: "Extracted 6 
    reasoning items" ✅
    - Root Cause: Data transformation gap between backend success and frontend display
    - Impact: Users can't see AI reasoning even when present

    Issue Category 5: File System Fragility (WINDOWS)

    Path Issues: Partially fixed but still occurring for in-flight requests
    - Pattern: Model names with / creating invalid Windows directories
    - Missing: Directory auto-creation, proper error recovery

    🛠️ Comprehensive Solution Architecture

    Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (Days 1-2)

    1A. Fix OpenRouter Continuation API Format

    // Research and implement correct format:
    // HYPOTHESIS: Pure continuation (no messages)
    {
      model: modelName,
      continue: { generation_id: previousId },
      response_format: { type: "json_object" }
    }
    // OR investigate if different endpoint needed

    1B. Robust File System Handling

    - Auto-create directories before writing
    - Validate Windows paths proactively
    - Graceful fallback when file ops fail
    - Handle colons in model names (model:free variants)

    1C. Frontend Data Pipeline Debug

    - Trace reasoning data from extraction → database → API → component
    - Add logging at each transformation step
    - Fix missing field mappings
    - Verify database schema alignment

    Phase 2: Provider Resilience (Days 3-4)

    2A. Provider Health Classification

    // Categorize failures:
    PROVIDER_ERROR: Empty responses, 524 errors (don't retry)
    NETWORK_TRUNCATION: Partial JSON (retry once)
    CLIENT_ERROR: 400 Bad Request (fix and retry)  
    RATE_LIMIT: 429 responses (backoff and retry)

    2B. Enhanced Truncation Detection

    - Network-level JSON validation (detect incomplete responses)
    - Content-length vs actual-length checking
    - Progressive JSON parsing (extract what we can)
    - Smarter retry logic based on failure type

    2C. Empty Response Handling

    - Detect pattern: 200 + stop + 0_chars
    - Mark as permanent provider failure
    - Log for monitoring and provider health tracking
    - Return structured error with clear explanation

    Phase 3: Observability & Monitoring (Day 5)

    3A. Success Rate Tracking

    // Per-model metrics:
    {
      modelName: "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
      successRate: 0.05, // 5% success
      lastSuccess: "2025-09-08T10:30:00Z",
      failurePatterns: ["EMPTY_RESPONSE", "PROVIDER_ERROR"]
    }

    3B. Structured Error Logging

    - Categorize all errors by type and fix difficulty
    - Track provider health over time
    - Alert when success rates drop below thresholds
    - Dashboard for model/provider status

    3C. Request Flow Debugging

    - End-to-end request tracing
    - Performance bottleneck identification
    - Data transformation verification
    - Frontend component debugging tools

    Phase 4: Architecture Hardening (Days 6-7)

    4A. Circuit Breaker Pattern

    - Temporarily disable consistently failing models
    - Auto-recovery when provider health improves
    - User notification of disabled models
    - Fallback to alternative models when possible

    4B. Queue-Based Retry System

    - Queue failed requests for intelligent retry
    - Exponential backoff for different error types
    - Batch retry during low-traffic periods
    - Dead letter queue for permanent failures

    4C. Provider Abstraction Layer

    - Normalize different provider response formats
    - Handle provider-specific quirks centrally
    - Easier integration of new providers
    - Consistent error handling across all providers

    🔬 Specific Technical Investigations Required

    OpenRouter API Research

    1. Documentation Review: Find official continuation API docs
    2. API Testing: Test different continuation payload formats
    3. Provider Differences: Check if continuation works differently per provider
    4. Rate Limit Impact: Understand retry implications

    Data Flow Tracing

    1. Database Verification: Confirm reasoning_items storage format
    2. API Response Mapping: Verify controller includes all fields
    3. Frontend Component: Check component expects correct data format
    4. Type Safety: Ensure TypeScript interfaces match reality

    Provider Health Analysis

    1. Failure Pattern Classification: Systematic categorization of all errors
    2. Provider Reliability Ranking: Which providers/models most reliable
    3. Geographic/Time Factors: Do failures correlate with load/region
    4. Model Lifecycle: Are some models deprecated/being phased out

    ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Strategy

    Change Management Risks

    - Test in Isolation: Each fix tested independently before integration
    - Rollback Plan: Ability to quickly revert any change
    - User will test, remember this is a hobby project, not enterprise software

    API Limit Risks

    - Rate Limit Awareness: Not an issue!  API limits are high
    - Batch Operations: Group retries to minimize API calls
    - Circuit Breakers: Prevent runaway retry loops
    - Usage Budgets: Set limits on retry attempts per model

    Data Integrity Risks

    - Backup Strategy: Backup critical data before major changes
    - Validation: Verify data integrity at each transformation step
    - Recovery Procedures: Plan for data corruption scenarios
    - Audit Trail: Track all data modifications
