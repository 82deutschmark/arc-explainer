# Plan: Resolve Missing Multiple Output Grids in Frontend

*   **Objective**: Diagnose and fix the issue where multiple predicted output grids, confirmed to be in the backend API response, are not being displayed on the frontend.

## 1. Problem Analysis

Based on the provided logs, the backend correctly receives and parses multiple prediction grids from the AI provider (e.g., `predictedOutput1`, `predictedOutput2`). However, the frontend UI indicates this data is not found. This points to a data contract mismatch between the backend API and the frontend components.

**Hypothesis**: The backend is not correctly transforming the multiple, individually-keyed prediction grids (`predictedOutput1`, `predictedOutput2`, etc.) from the raw provider response into a unified array that the frontend expects.

## 2. Investigation & Resolution Plan

### Step 1: Backend Data Transformation Analysis
- **Action**: Examine `server/services/explanationService.ts` and `server/controllers/explanationController.ts`.
- **Goal**: Understand how raw provider responses are processed, specifically how fields like `predictedOutput1`, `predictedOutput2`, etc., are handled. Determine if they are being consolidated into a single array before being sent to the client.
- **Expected Outcome**: Identify the exact point where the multiple output grids are either dropped or not aggregated into the expected format.

### Step 2: Frontend Data Consumption Analysis
- **Action**: Review `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx` and related components.
- **Goal**: Determine the data structure the frontend expects for displaying multiple grids. Check the TypeScript types (`shared/types.ts`) for the explanation object to see what field it expects (e.g., `multiplePredictedOutputs: Grid[]`).
- **Expected Outcome**: Confirm the data structure the frontend requires, which will inform the necessary backend changes.

### Step 3: Implement Backend Fix
- **Action**: Modify `server/services/explanationService.ts`.
- **Goal**: Add logic to iterate through the raw response, find all keys matching the pattern `predictedOutput[0-9]+`, collect their grid values, and place them into a single array on the main explanation object that is sent to the frontend. This ensures a consistent data structure regardless of the provider's response format.

### Step 4: Verification
- **Action**: After deploying the fix, the user will test the frontend.
- **Goal**: Confirm that the `PuzzleExaminer` page now correctly displays all multiple output grids returned by the AI model.
