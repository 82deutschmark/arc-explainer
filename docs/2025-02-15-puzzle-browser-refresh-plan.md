# 2025-02-15 Puzzle Browser refresh plan

## Goal
Revert the Puzzle Browser page to its prior structure, then restyle it to present a focused research interface that aligns with ARC-AGI analysis workflows.

## Target files
- `client/src/pages/PuzzleBrowser.tsx`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

## Tasks
1. Restore the historical implementation of `PuzzleBrowser.tsx` from the last stable commit.
2. Replace the purple gradient and heavy visual effects with a subdued slate/graphite palette suitable for research-focused UI.
3. Tighten layout spacing by reducing outer padding, removing decorative margins, and simplifying header composition.
4. De-emphasize the search input by relocating it beneath the filters with compact styling while keeping direct ID lookup functionality intact.
5. Adjust reference/resource sections to use plain text links instead of CTA-style buttons.
6. Review the filters/results cards to ensure consistency with the new palette and low-key visual style.
7. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of the restored layout and visual refinements.
