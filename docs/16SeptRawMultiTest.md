    "Best: Replace the single non-zero color with 0 and replace all background zeros with a color specific to that original color (matches training mappings). Accepted because every training output has zeros exactly where the original colored pixels were and a uniform other color elsewhere.",
    "Considered: Use a color computed from counts (e.g., count of occurrences) then fill backgrounds with that number. Rejected because counts do not match the output values for all examples.",
    "Considered: Use a function of the original color (arithmetic formula). Rejected because no consistent simple arithmetic formula fits all mappings, so use the learned fixed mapping per color instead."

  "reasoningLog": "[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Mapping color outputs**\\n\\nI need to map color numbers to outputs based on given examples. For instance, in Example 1, if the input has an 8, it results in a 0 at those positions, while other positions show a 2. In Example 2, zeros appear where the input color 3 is located, with the rest being 1s. So the conclusion is: for input colors like 3, the output is all zeros in those positions, while other colors designate other constant outputs.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Defining color transformations**\\n\\nI need to establish a rule for transforming colors: I’ll replace non-background colors (unique colors besides 0) with 0, and change zeros into a new color based on the original color minus 6. For example, an 8 becomes a 2, a 5 becomes a 4, and a 3 becomes a 1. It seems like the transformation involves counting occurrences but also specific examples like input with multiple 5s leading to zeros in those positions confirm that I should convert target colors to 0, while mapping zeros to other designated colors.\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Exploring color mapping**\\n\\nI’m trying to figure out the mapping for colors. Initially, I thought it could be color transformed by (9 - color), but that's not consistent since 9 - 8 = 1 instead of 2. So then I wondered if it could involve XOR operations, but that didn't pan out either. I looked at the outputs for examples and considered if mapping could relate to the count of occurrences of the target color in the input, but the relationships seem inconsistent. I need to keep refining this to find the right logic!\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Analyzing output mappings**\\n\\nI’m analyzing Example 4, where the input has four instances of 5, and the output uses 4 for the background. In contrast, Example 2 has three 3s, yet the output background is 1. I began wondering if the background value could be based on the grid size minus the count, but that doesn’t hold up. Similarly, for Example 5 and 6 with three 8s, the output shows 2. I’m starting to see a pattern that the background color might relate to the number of non-target-color cells, but I need to explore this further!\"},{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Establishing consistent mappings**\\n\\nI'm considering that the mapping could actually be a simple, consistent formula: like 8 maps to 2, 3 maps to 1, and 5 maps to 4. For Test 1, where the target color is 3, the background should then be 1, making the output grid have zeros where 3s are and ones elsewhere. For the input grid of Test 1, I can calculate the positions accordingly resulting in output like [[0,1,1],[0,0,0],[1,1,0]]. In Test 2, where color 5 maps to 4, I’ll again replace colors to create the correct output. I can format everything into JSON with the predicted outputs too!\"}]",
