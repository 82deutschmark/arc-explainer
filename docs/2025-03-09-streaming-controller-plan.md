# 2025-03-09 Streaming controller polish

## Goal
Align the analysis streaming controller with the updated SSE handshake expectations and restore passing TypeScript checks.

## Tasks
- [x] Inspect `server/controllers/streamController.ts` for outdated helpers causing type violations.
- [x] Adjust undefined-pruning utility to support strongly typed option objects.
- [x] Re-run `npm run check` to confirm TS2345 errors are resolved.
