# ARC-AGI Batch Testing System with GPT-5-Nano

*Created: August 22, 2025*
*Author: Cascade*

## Overview

This document describes the batch testing system designed for evaluating all 118 puzzles in the `evaluation2` dataset using GPT-5-nano with minimal reasoning and low verbosity settings.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Batch Processor** (`scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py`)
   - Orchestrates the entire batch process
   - Handles rate limiting, progress tracking, and error recovery
   - Integrates with existing server infrastructure

2. **Server Integration** 
   - Uses existing `puzzleController.analyze` endpoint
   - Leverages `buildAnalysisPrompt()` with "solver" template
   - Automatic DB storage via `explanationService`

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - JSON-based resume capability
   - Detailed success/failure logging
   - Real-time status monitoring

### Data Flow

```
Evaluation2 JSON Files → Batch Processor → HTTP POST → Server API → 
buildAnalysisPrompt() → OpenAI GPT-5-nano → Response Validation → 
DB Storage via explanationService → Progress Tracking
```

## Key Features

### Rate Limiting & Stability
- **2-second delays** between requests for API stability
- **5-minute timeout** per puzzle to handle slow responses
- **Retry logic** for transient failures

### Prompt Configuration
- **Solver mode**: Uses 1-shot prompting template
- **Minimal reasoning**: `reasoningEffort: "minimal"`
- **Low verbosity**: `reasoningVerbosity: "minimal"`
- **Answer omission**: `omitAnswer: true` (puzzle data without solutions)
- **ARC system prompts**: `systemPromptMode: "ARC"`

### Progress Management
- **Resumable**: Can restart from any puzzle
- **Status tracking**: Completed/failed/remaining counts
- **Success metrics**: Accuracy scores and timing data
- **Error logging**: Detailed failure reasons

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test the system first (3 puzzles)
python scripts/test_batch_system.py

# Run full batch (118 puzzles, ~4 minutes with rate limiting)
python scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py

# Check current status
python scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py --status
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Limit to 10 puzzles for testing
python scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py --max 10

# Start from specific puzzle
python scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py --start-from "135a2760"

# Custom rate limiting (1 second delay)
python scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py --delay 1.0

# Use different progress file
python scripts/batch_solver_gpt5nano.py --progress-file my_batch.json
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Running**: Backend must be active on `localhost:5000`
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Must be configured in `.env` file
3. **Database Connected**: For storing results
4. **Python Dependencies**: `requests`, `python-dotenv`

## Expected Performance

- **Total Runtime**: ~4 minutes (118 puzzles × 2-second delay + processing time)
- **GPT-5-nano Response Time**: Near-instant for most puzzles
- **Success Rate**: Dependent on puzzle complexity and model performance
- **Storage**: Results automatically stored in existing DB schema

## Output Data

Each processed puzzle generates:
- **Prediction Grid**: Model's solution attempt
- **Accuracy Score**: Percentage match with correct answer
- **Processing Time**: API response timing
- **Reasoning Log**: GPT-5's step-by-step analysis
- **Success Flag**: Whether prediction was correct

## Error Handling

- **Network Issues**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **API Timeouts**: 5-minute limit per puzzle
- **Server Errors**: Logged with full error details
- **Data Corruption**: Validation of puzzle file format
- **Resume Capability**: Failed puzzles can be reprocessed individually

## Integration Benefits

This system leverages your existing infrastructure:
- **No duplicate code**: Reuses `promptBuilder`, `aiServiceFactory`
- **Consistent prompting**: Same solver template as UI
- **Automatic storage**: Uses existing DB schema and services
- **Progress tracking**: Compatible with existing explanation system
- **Error handling**: Benefits from server-side validation

## Monitoring & Analytics

The system provides detailed metrics for analysis:
- Per-puzzle success/failure rates
- Response time distributions
- Accuracy score histograms
- Error pattern analysis
- Model performance benchmarking

This enables comprehensive evaluation of GPT-5-nano's ARC-AGI solving capabilities across the entire evaluation2 dataset.
