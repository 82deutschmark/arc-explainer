# Puzzle Browser Refresh Plan (2025-02-03)

## Objective
Bring the Puzzle Browser landing experience in line with the Saturn Visual Solver aesthetics: dense information, muted palette, minimal gradients.

## Files & Responsibilities
- `client/src/pages/PuzzleBrowser.tsx` â€” Update layout structure, tighten spacing, replace gradients with neutral, professional styling while reusing existing data flows.

## TODO Checklist
- [x] Audit existing Saturn Visual Solver styling cues for density and palette.
- [x] Redesign hero/search header with compact stats and actionable search.
- [x] Rework acknowledgement and knowledge hub sections to neutral surfaces.
- [x] Align filter and results containers with new palette.
- [ ] Capture updated UI screenshot once frontend is running (requires dev server).

## Notes for User Feedback
- Buttons remain DaisyUI components to preserve theme integration.
- Data hooks and filtering logic unchanged; only presentation was refined.
- Collapsible community insight now matches rest of design while remaining accessible.
