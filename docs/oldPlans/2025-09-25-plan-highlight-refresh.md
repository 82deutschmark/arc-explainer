# 2025-09-25 Highlight Summary Refresh Plan

## Objectives
- **Contextualize** key system achievements across backend, frontend, analytics, and automation.
- **Capture** distinctive wins compared to the prior SFMC project highlight style.
- **Deliver** a refined `AI-Built-ARC-Explainer-Highlights.md` that excites stakeholders.

## Tasks
1. Review high-signal documents (`CLAUDE.md`, recent `CHANGELOG.md` entries, analytics and lessons learned docs) to extract standout accomplishments.
2. Synthesize themes (architecture overhauls, solver innovations, analytics breakthroughs, automation tooling) with concrete proof points.
3. Rewrite highlights document with richer narrative, ensuring required header block and alignment with hobby-scale context.
4. Validate tone and accuracy; prep summary of remaining follow-ups for the user.

## Notes
- Prior summary felt generic; emphasize unique differentiators like multi-test recovery, cost architecture, reasoning capture, and batch system.
- Maintain approachable language for a hobbyist audience while showcasing engineering rigor.
