# Multi-Test Storage Bug Investigation - August 24, 2025

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: Multi-test puzzles (those requiring 2+ predicted outputs) are not being stored properly in the database, despite AI models returning the correct structured response format.

**Symptoms**:
- Single-test puzzles work fine and store correctly
- Multi-test puzzles show incomplete or corrupted data in database 
- Some database entries have "[object Object]" in reasoning logs (serialization issue)
- Frontend shows empty results for multi-test cases even when AI provided valid predictions

## Current Status

**Working State**: Reverted to commit `640d6e8` on new branch `fix-multi-test-storage`
- Build passes ‚úÖ
- Single-test functionality confirmed working ‚úÖ
- Ready for surgical debugging of multi-test storage pipeline

## AI Response Format (CONFIRMED WORKING)

AI models correctly return multi-test responses in this format:
```json
{
  "multiplePredictedOutputs": true,
  "predictedOutput1": [[3]],
  "predictedOutput2": [[6]], 
  "predictedOutput3": [[2]],
  "solvingStrategy": "Analyzed the training..."
}
```

## Test Cases

**Known multi-test puzzles for testing**:
- `20a9e565.json` - 2 test cases (requires 2 predicted outputs)
- `27a28665.json` - 3 test cases (requires 3 predicted outputs) 
- `a8610ef7.json` - 1 test case (for comparison)

## Data Flow Analysis

**Expected Path**:
1. **AI Response** ‚Üí Structured JSON with `multiplePredictedOutputs: true`
2. **JSON Parsing** ‚Üí `parseJsonWithFallback()` in OpenAI service
3. **Response Validation** ‚Üí `responseValidator.ts` calls `extractPredictions()`
4. **Extraction Logic** ‚Üí `solver.ts` collects numbered fields into array
5. **Database Storage** ‚Üí Controller stores `multiplePredictedOutputs` array
6. **Frontend Display** ‚Üí AnalysisResultCard shows multiple test grids

**Investigation Status**:
- ‚úÖ Step 1: AI Response - Confirmed working 
- ‚úÖ Step 4: Extraction Logic - Code looks correct in `extractPredictions()`
- üîç **Current Focus**: Steps 2-3, 5-6 need investigation

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Trace Data Flow
- [x] Verify build works and single-tests pass
- [ ] Debug `responseValidator.ts` handling of extracted multi-test predictions
- [ ] Audit database storage serialization in puzzle controller
- [ ] Check field name consistency between extraction and storage

### Phase 2: Fix Storage Bug
- [ ] Identify exact point where multi-test data gets corrupted/lost
- [ ] Fix serialization issue causing "[object Object]" entries
- [ ] Ensure `multiplePredictedOutputs` array gets stored properly

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Test with known multi-test puzzles (20a9e565, 27a28665)
- [ ] Verify frontend displays multiple test cases correctly
- [ ] Clean up corrupted database entries if needed

## Key Constraints

- **DO NOT change system prompts** - They're working correctly
- **DO NOT change AI response format** - It's already structured properly
- **Focus on data processing pipeline** - The bug is in storage/serialization
- **Preserve single-test functionality** - Don't break what's working

## Architecture Notes

- **Multi-provider support**: Must work across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek
- **JSON-in-prompt approach**: Correct for cross-provider compatibility 
- **Database schema**: `multiplePredictedOutputs` field stores array of grids
- **Frontend ready**: AnalysisResultCard already handles multi-test display

## Recovery Context

**What happened**: Earlier today, attempts to "clean up hallucinated structured output API" accidentally broke working functionality by removing critical data processing logic.

**Recovery action**: Created new branch from working state before destructive changes, ready for focused debugging of the actual storage issue.
