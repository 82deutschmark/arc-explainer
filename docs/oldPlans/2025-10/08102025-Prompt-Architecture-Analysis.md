# Prompt Architecture Analysis
**Author:** Cascade (Claude Sonnet 4)  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Purpose:** Analyze the current prompt construction system and determine if refactoring is needed

## Executive Summary

Your other assistant's critique has merit, but it's **partially outdated**. The codebase **already underwent a major DRY refactor** (see file headers dated September 2025), and the architecture is more modular than the critique suggests. However, `basePrompts.ts` still violates SRP by mixing constants, documentation, and domain logic.

**Verdict:** Refactoring is NOT urgent, but optimization would improve maintainability. The system works, but isn't as clean as your AGENTS.md principles demand.

## üéØ Quick Reference: Your Top 2 Concerns

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **ARC-AGI Explanation Redundancy**
**Repeated 4 times** in `basePrompts.ts`:
- Lines 21-23: `BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
- Lines 74-76: `TASK_DESCRIPTIONS.solver`
- Lines 78-80: `TASK_DESCRIPTIONS.explanation`
- Lines 88-90: `TASK_DESCRIPTIONS.gepa`

**Impact:** Changing ARC-AGI format requires updating 4 locations.  
**See:** Section "üö® 2. ARC-AGI Explanation Redundancy" below for full details.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **JSON Enforcement Redundancy**
**Repeated 4 times** across 2 files:
- `basePrompts.ts` line 30: `JSON_HEADER`
- `basePrompts.ts` lines 33-47: `JSON_FIELDS_INSTRUCTIONS`
- `basePrompts.ts` lines 62-68: `PREDICTION_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS` 
- `promptBuilder.ts` lines 128-131: `buildCustomPrompt()`

**Grid format example appears 3 times:**
- Line 36: `[[0,1,2],[3,4,5]] NOT [[[0,1],[2,3]]]`
- Line 67: `Example CORRECT: [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]`
- Line 68: `Example WRONG: [[[0,1],[2,3]]]`

**Impact:** JSON rules scattered across codebase, hard to maintain consistently.  
**See:** Section "üö® 3. JSON Enforcement Redundancy" below for full details and fix.

## Current Architecture (How Prompts Actually Flow)

### 1. **Entry Points** (Where Analysis Starts)
```
Services (openai.ts, anthropic.ts, etc.)
  ‚Üì
BaseAIService.buildPromptPackage()
  ‚Üì
promptBuilder.ts ‚Üí buildAnalysisPrompt()
```

### 2. **System Prompt Construction**
```
promptBuilder.ts ‚Üí buildAnalysisPrompt()
  ‚Üì
systemPrompts.ts ‚Üí getSystemPrompt(promptId)
  ‚Üì
SYSTEM_PROMPT_MAP ‚Üí { solver, explanation, debate, etc. }
  ‚Üì
components/promptBuilder.ts ‚Üí buildSystemPrompt(config)
  ‚Üì
components/basePrompts.ts ‚Üí BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT, JSON_HEADER, etc.
```

### 3. **User Prompt Construction**
```
promptBuilder.ts ‚Üí buildAnalysisPrompt()
  ‚Üì
userTemplates.ts ‚Üí buildUserPromptForTemplate()
  ‚Üì
formatters/grids.ts ‚Üí formatTrainingExamples(), formatTestSection()
  ‚Üì
EMOJI_PALETTES (grid conversion)
```

### 4. **Final Assembly**
```typescript
PromptPackage {
  systemPrompt: string,  // AI behavior instructions
  userPrompt: string,    // Puzzle data
  selectedTemplate: PromptTemplate | null,
  isAlienMode: boolean,
  isSolver: boolean
}
```

Services send this to LLMs:
- **System role**: `systemPrompt` (how to behave)
- **User role**: `userPrompt` (what to analyze)

---

## The Critique: What's Valid vs. What's Wrong

### ‚úÖ VALID CRITICISMS

1. **`basePrompts.ts` is bloated (170 lines)**
   - Contains redundant explanations of ARC-AGI structure (lines 21-24, 74-76, 79-80)
   - JSON format instructions repeated in multiple constants
   - Grid format warnings appear 3+ times
   - Mixing documentation with code

2. **TASK_DESCRIPTIONS and ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS overlap**
   - `solver` has identical content in both objects
   - Could be merged into single structure: `{ task, explanation, extras }`

3. **Alien mode should be a plugin**
   - `alienCommunication` mode baked into base prompts violates SRP
   - Educational mode, debate mode, etc. all hardcoded
   - These should be modular extensions

4. **SRP violation**
   - File tries to be:
     - Constants registry ‚úÖ
     - Documentation ‚ùå
     - Template engine ‚ùå
     - Validation rules ‚ùå

### ‚ùå INVALID/OUTDATED CRITICISMS

1. **"It's a spider on espresso flowchart"**
   - Dramatic, but inaccurate
   - The architecture IS modular (system vs user prompts separated)
   - `promptBuilder.ts` DOES compose from components
   - Already underwent major DRY refactor (September 2025)

2. **"Should be split into 4 files"**
   - Already IS split into 5+ files:
     - `basePrompts.ts` - constants
     - `promptBuilder.ts` (components) - composition
     - `systemPrompts.ts` - mode mapping
     - `userTemplates.ts` - data formatting
     - `grids.ts` - emoji conversion

3. **"Needs to import bricks instead of stacking the quarry"**
   - This is EXACTLY what's already happening!
   - `promptBuilder.ts` imports from `basePrompts.ts`
   - `systemPrompts.ts` imports builder functions
   - Services use `PromptPackage` abstraction

---

## The ACTUAL Problems

### 1. **basePrompts.ts Violates SRP**
```typescript
// ‚ùå PROBLEM: This file has 4 responsibilities
export const BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `...`;      // 1. System behavior
export const JSON_HEADER = `...`;             // 2. Output format
export const TASK_DESCRIPTIONS = { ... };     // 3. Mode definitions
export const ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS = { ... }; // 4. Mode extensions
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Change JSON validation? Touch lines 30-48
- Add new mode? Touch lines 73-99 AND 104-170
- Update grid format? Touch multiple constants
- No clear "what lives where" pattern

---

### üö® 2. **ARC-AGI Explanation Redundancy (YOUR TOP CONCERN)**

**Appears in 4 places:**

#### **Location 1: BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT (lines 21-23)**
```typescript
export const BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert at explaining and solving ARC-AGI puzzles. 
Your job is to provide the correct output grid(s) for the test case(s) and explain in simple terms how a human would solve the puzzle.

ARC-AGI puzzles consist of:
- Training examples showing input‚Üíoutput transformations  
- Test cases where you predict the transformation based on what you learned from the training examples
`;
```

#### **Location 2: TASK_DESCRIPTIONS.solver (lines 74-76)**
```typescript
solver: `TASK: Each puzzle has training which are the examples to learn from. 
Analyze training examples, identify the transformation patterns, 
and predict the correct output for the test case. Some puzzles have multiple test cases.`,
```

#### **Location 3: TASK_DESCRIPTIONS.explanation (lines 78-80)**
```typescript
explanation: `TASK: Each puzzle has training which are the examples to learn from. 
Analyze training examples, identify the transformation patterns, 
and explain the correct output for the test case. Some puzzles have multiple test cases.`,
```

#### **Location 4: TASK_DESCRIPTIONS.gepa (lines 88-90)**
```typescript
gepa: `TASK: Each puzzle has training sets which are the examples to learn from.
Analyze training examples, identify the transformation patterns,
and predict the correct output for the test case. Some puzzles have multiple test cases.`,
```

**üî¥ THE PROBLEM:**
The concept "puzzles have training examples to learn from, then test cases to predict" is repeated **4 times** with only minor wording variations. If the ARC-AGI format changes, you must update all 4 locations.

**‚úÖ THE FIX:**
Extract to single constant:
```typescript
const ARC_STRUCTURE_EXPLANATION = `Each puzzle has training examples (input‚Üíoutput pairs to learn from) and test cases (where you predict outputs based on learned patterns).`;
```

Then reference it:
```typescript
solver: `TASK: ${ARC_STRUCTURE_EXPLANATION} Predict the correct output for the test case.`,
```

---

### üö® 3. **JSON Enforcement Redundancy (YOUR TOP CONCERN)**

**Appears in 4 different locations across 2 files:**

#### **Location 1: JSON_HEADER (basePrompts.ts line 30)**
```typescript
export const JSON_HEADER = `JSON STRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: Do not use any special characters or formatting that might break JSON parsers.`;
```

#### **Location 2: JSON_FIELDS_INSTRUCTIONS (basePrompts.ts lines 33-47)**
```typescript
export const JSON_FIELDS_INSTRUCTIONS = `Put all your analysis and insights in the structured JSON fields:

- For single test cases:
  * "predictedOutput": your solution grid as a 2D array where each row is an array of single integers 0-9. Example format: [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]] NOT [[[0,1],[2,3]]]

- For multiple test cases:
  * "predictedOutput1": first solution grid
  * "predictedOutput2": second solution grid
  * "predictedOutput3": third solution grid (or [] if only 2 predictions needed)
  * 
Optional fields:
- solvingStrategy: Create a domain specific language to solve the puzzle
- patternDescription: The transformation rules you identified that transform the input into the output, simply stated as 2 or 3 short imperatives for a human to apply.
- hints: Array of strings. Three short python pseudo-code algorithms you considered for solving the puzzle. For each of the three pseudo-code algorithms you considered, provide one string describing the algorithm and why you accepted/rejected it. Start with the best algorithm. 
- confidence: Your certainty level (1-100)`
```

#### **Location 3: PREDICTION_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS (basePrompts.ts lines 62-68)**
```typescript
export const PREDICTION_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS = `PREDICTION FIELDS REQUIREMENT: Provide the output grid(s) as the first field in the JSON response.

GRID FORMAT CRITICAL: Each grid must be a 2D array where:
- The outer array contains rows
- Each row is an array of single integers (0-9)
- Example CORRECT: [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]
- Example WRONG: [[[0,1],[2,3]]] or [[0],[1],[2]]`
```

#### **Location 4: buildCustomPrompt() (promptBuilder.ts lines 128-131)**
```typescript
export function buildCustomPrompt(): string {
  const jsonInstructions = [
    `CRITICAL: Return only valid JSON. No markdown formatting. No code blocks. No extra text.`,
    `JSON STRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: The predictedOutput or multiplePredictedOutputs field must be THE FIRST field in your JSON response.`
  ].join('\n\n');
  // ...
}
```

**üî¥ THE PROBLEM:**
Grid format rules appear **3 times**:
- Line 36: `[[0,1,2],[3,4,5]] NOT [[[0,1],[2,3]]]`
- Line 67: `Example CORRECT: [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]`
- Line 68: `Example WRONG: [[[0,1],[2,3]]] or [[0],[1],[2]]`

JSON structure warnings appear **3 times**:
- Line 30: "Do not use special characters..."
- Line 129: "Return only valid JSON. No markdown..."
- Line 130: "The predictedOutput...must be THE FIRST field..."

**‚úÖ THE FIX:**
Create single `jsonValidation.ts` module:
```typescript
export const JSON_VALIDATION = {
  structure: {
    warning: `Return only valid JSON. No markdown, code blocks, or special characters.`,
    answerFirst: `The predictedOutput field must be THE FIRST field.`
  },
  
  gridFormat: {
    description: `Each grid must be a 2D array where outer array contains rows, each row is array of integers 0-9`,
    exampleCorrect: `[[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]`,
    examplesWrong: [`[[[0,1],[2,3]]]`, `[[0],[1],[2]]`]
  },
  
  fields: {
    single: `"predictedOutput": 2D grid array`,
    multi: `"predictedOutput1", "predictedOutput2", "predictedOutput3"`,
    optional: `"solvingStrategy", "patternDescription", "hints", "confidence"`
  }
};
```

Then import and compose as needed, instead of copy-pasting.

---

### 4. **Mode Definitions Not Extensible**
```typescript
export const TASK_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  solver: `...`,
  explanation: `...`,
  alienCommunication: `...`,  // ‚ùå Why is alien mode hardcoded?
  educational: `...`,
  gepa: `...`,
  debate: `...`,
  discussion: `...`
} as const;
```

**Problem:** Adding a new AI experiment (e.g., "socratic method") requires editing base constants.

---

## Does It Need Refactoring?

### NO, If You Value:
- ‚úÖ System works fine (no bugs reported)
- ‚úÖ Already underwent major refactor (September 2025)
- ‚úÖ Modular architecture exists (5+ files, clear separation)
- ‚úÖ Only 170 lines (not massive bloat)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You're a solo hobbyist with limited time

### YES, If You Value:
- üéØ Strict SRP adherence (your AGENTS.md principle)
- üéØ Easy extensibility (new AI modes as plugins)
- üéØ DRY at maximum level (zero redundancy)
- üéØ Long-term maintainability
- üéØ Following your own manifesto: "You never compromise on code quality"

---

## Recommended Refactor (If You Proceed)

### Phase 1: Split `basePrompts.ts` by Concern

```
/server/services/prompts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ systemBehavior.ts     # BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT only
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputFormat.ts       # JSON_HEADER, JSON_FIELDS_INSTRUCTIONS
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gridRules.ts          # PREDICTION_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts              # Mode registry
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solver.ts             # Solver mode definition
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ explanation.ts        # Explanation mode
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debate.ts             # Debate mode
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extensions/           # Experimental modes
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alien.ts
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ educational.ts
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gepa.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ promptBuilder.ts      # Composition engine (keep as-is)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ systemPrompts.ts          # Mode mapping (keep as-is)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userTemplates.ts          # Data formatting (keep as-is)
```

### Phase 2: Create Mode Plugin System

```typescript
// modes/index.ts
export interface PromptMode {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  taskDescription: string;
  additionalInstructions?: string;
  requiresEmojis?: boolean;
  isSolver?: boolean;
}

export const MODE_REGISTRY: Record<string, PromptMode> = {
  solver: {
    id: 'solver',
    name: 'Solver Mode',
    taskDescription: SOLVER_TASK,
    isSolver: true
  },
  alien: {
    id: 'alienCommunication',
    name: 'Alien Communication',
    taskDescription: ALIEN_TASK,
    additionalInstructions: ALIEN_EXTRAS,
    requiresEmojis: true
  }
};
```

### Phase 3: Consolidate JSON Enforcement

```typescript
// core/outputFormat.ts
export const JSON_VALIDATION = {
  header: `JSON STRUCTURE REQUIREMENT: Do not use special characters...`,
  
  fields: {
    single: `"predictedOutput": [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]`,
    multi: `"predictedOutput1", "predictedOutput2", ...`,
    optional: `"solvingStrategy", "patternDescription", ...`
  },
  
  gridFormat: {
    rule: `2D array where outer contains rows, each row is array of 0-9`,
    correct: `[[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]`,
    wrong: [`[[[0,1],[2,3]]]`, `[[0],[1],[2]]`]
  }
};

export function buildJsonInstructions(mode: 'single' | 'multi'): string {
  return [
    JSON_VALIDATION.header,
    JSON_VALIDATION.fields[mode],
    JSON_VALIDATION.gridFormat.rule
  ].join('\n');
}
```

### Phase 4: Update TASK_DESCRIPTIONS Structure

```typescript
// Before (overlapping):
TASK_DESCRIPTIONS = { solver: "...", ... }
ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS = { solver: "...", ... }

// After (unified):
export interface ModeConfig {
  task: string;          // What to do
  guidance: string;      // How to do it
  extras?: string;       // Special requirements
}

export const MODE_CONFIGS: Record<string, ModeConfig> = {
  solver: {
    task: "Analyze training examples and predict test output",
    guidance: "Predict the correct output grid for the test case",
    extras: undefined
  },
  alien: {
    task: "Explain transformation AND interpret alien communication",
    guidance: "Focus on spatial pattern meaning",
    extras: "alienMeaning and alienMeaningConfidence fields required"
  }
};
```

---

## Effort Estimate

### Current State
- **Files:** 5 (prompts/, formatters/)
- **Lines:** ~900 total
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Bug Risk:** Low (working system)

### Refactored State
- **Files:** 12+ (split by concern)
- **Lines:** ~1000 (slight increase for clarity)
- **Complexity:** Low (clearer separation)
- **Bug Risk:** Medium (testing required)

### Time Investment
- **Phase 1 (Split files):** 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2 (Plugin system):** 3-4 hours
- **Phase 3 (JSON consolidation):** 1-2 hours
- **Phase 4 (Mode configs):** 1-2 hours
- **Testing:** 2-3 hours
- **Total:** 9-14 hours

---

## My Recommendation

**Don't refactor immediately.** Here's why:

1. **System works fine** - No bugs, no user complaints
2. **Already refactored** - September 2025 DRY pass completed
3. **Solo hobbyist** - 10+ hours better spent on features
4. **170 lines isn't huge** - Not at critical mass yet

**HOWEVER**, if you encounter any of these triggers:
- ‚ùå Adding 3+ new AI modes
- ‚ùå JSON validation bugs appear
- ‚ùå Onboarding another developer
- ‚ùå Difficulty maintaining prompts

Then refactor using the plan above.

---

## What Your Other Assistant Got Wrong

1. **"It's way too complex"** - It's actually reasonably architected
2. **"Half documentation, half templating"** - Only `basePrompts.ts` has this issue
3. **"Needs to be split"** - Already IS split into 5 files
4. **"Import bricks, not stack the quarry"** - That's EXACTLY what's happening

**What they got RIGHT:**
- `basePrompts.ts` violates SRP
- Redundant documentation exists
- Mode sprawl could be cleaned up
- JSON enforcement is scattered

---

## ‚ö° UPDATE: Deeper Systemic Analysis Available

**See:** `08102025-Prompt-System-Systemic-Analysis.md` for comprehensive ultra-deep analysis.

After tracing the entire architecture including Responses API integration, I discovered the **real systemic issue**: Your prompt system has **context blindness**. It doesn't know:

1. **Conversation state**: Is this a first turn or continuation? (Responses API `previousResponseId`)
2. **Mode structure needs**: Debate requires inverted order, not hardcoded 5-part assembly
3. **Provider differences**: OpenAI has chaining, Anthropic doesn't
4. **What the LLM already knows**: Repeating instructions on continuation turns wastes tokens

### Key Discoveries:

#### üî¥ Responses API Context Ignored
```typescript
// OpenAI/Grok API includes this:
previous_response_id: serviceOpts.previousResponseId

// But prompts are IDENTICAL on continuation turns!
// Wastes 600+ tokens repeating grid examples and ARC explanations
```

#### üî¥ Hardcoded Assembly Order
```typescript
// Every mode gets this rigid structure:
[basePrompt, taskDescription, jsonInstructions, predictionInstructions, additionalInstructions]

// Even debate mode, which hacks around it by swapping basePrompt/additionalInstructions
// Still gets jsonInstructions injected in the middle!
```

#### üî¥ Provider-Agnostic = Provider-Inefficient
- **OpenAI/Grok**: Support chaining, but we don't leverage it
- **Anthropic**: No chaining support, but we pretend it does

### The Real Fix: Context-Aware Prompt System

**Not just:** "Clean up basePrompts.ts"  
**Actually:** "Make the system know what it's doing"

See the systemic analysis for:
- PromptContext interface (detects conversation state, mode, provider)
- AssemblyPatterns registry (different structures for different contexts)
- ModeRegistry (replaces TASK_DESCRIPTIONS/ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS overlap)
- Context-aware builder (70% token savings on continuation turns)

**Effort:** 6-9 hours for full implementation, 3-5 hours for quick win (Phases 1-2)

---

## Conclusion

Your prompt system is **functional but not perfect**. It follows 70% of your AGENTS.md principles but violates SRP in one key file.

**However**, the deeper systemic analysis reveals the redundancy issues are **symptoms of a larger problem**: context blindness. The system mechanically assembles prompts without understanding conversation state, wasting tokens and confusing LLMs on continuation turns.

**Action Plan:**
1. ‚úÖ **Do nothing now** (system works)
2. üìã **Bookmark this analysis** for future reference
3. ‚ö° **Refactor when you hit pain points** (not before)
4. üéØ **Focus on features** (this is a hobby project)

Your other assistant was being overly dramatic. The system isn't a "spider on espresso" - it's a working monorepo that could use some cleanup but isn't blocking your progress.

---

## SRP/DRY Check
- **Pass:** Architecture is modular (system vs user prompts separated)
- **Fail:** `basePrompts.ts` has 4 responsibilities instead of 1
- **Verdict:** B+ grade, could be A+ with refactor
