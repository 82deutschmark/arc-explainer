Here's what I found in the OpenRouter docs and what we can do to recover costly truncated API calls:
Also remember that we have lots of local debug files in the `explained` folder that we can potentially use for debug.  We can match the puzzle ID to the DB entire for that ID and determine if any of our local files are missing from the DB and contain the missing data.  We can then use that data to continue the explanation where it left off or maybe recover the data.


###  UPDATE!!  
  I JUST DISCOVERED THE SOURCE OF THE PERSISTENT TRUNCATION ISSUES!!!  It has something to do with streaming!  we only ever expect ONE reply from a model, but some of them give us their answer in MULTIPLE replies to the same single API call!  OUR CODE NEVER EXPECTS THIS AND DOES NOT HANDLE IT AT ALL!

### What the Documentation Actually Covers

* **Generation Lookup**: OpenRouter offers a `/api/v1/generation/{generation_id}` endpoint that delivers full metadata (prompt, completion, and token accounting) for a past call—even if your client received a truncated response. That endpoint can be used to determine whether the truncation happened server-side or during transit. ([OpenRouter][1])

* **Usage Accounting**: You can optionally enable `"usage": {"include": true}` in your chat/completions request. This includes token counts, cost, and more in the final response or in the last SSE message for streamed calls. This is helpful to determine how costly each API call was, and to audit usage before recovery. ([OpenRouter][2])

* **Finish Reason**: Look out for `finish_reason == "length"` in the response; that signals the generation ended early due to hitting token limits. ([OpenRouter][1])

**No documented “continue” parameter exists** in the official OpenRouter API schema for continuing a truncated call. Continuation workflows must be implemented client-side by reissuing requests with preserved context or partial output as prompt.

### Recommended Rescue Workflow Script (Outline Only, No Code)

**Goal**: Identify truncated, high-cost calls and resume them to completion!!!

#### A) Identify Candidates for Recovery

1. Query (using proper syntax for Windows powershell queries) your call logs (DB) for past calls where:

   * `finish_reason` is `"length"`.
   * The response failed JSON parsing mid-stream or was incomplete.
   * Cost (token or credit) is above a defined threshold.

2. For each candidate, extract its `generation_id`.

#### B) Diagnose Using Generation Lookup API

3. Call:

   ```
   GET /api/v1/generation/{generation_id}
   ```

   Use the returned prompt and completion text to see if it's truncated **on the server**. If server-side content is complete, client transport issues may be to blame.

#### C) Continue the Response Client-Side

4. If the generation was indeed truncated:

   * Reissue a fresh chat/completion request with the same context.
   * Either include the partial assistant output as a preceding assistant message, or prompt “Continue from the last output. Do not repeat earlier content.”
   * Set `"usage": {"include": true}` to track token consumption.
   * Loop until `finish_reason != "length"`.

#### D) Record & Merge Output

5. Append all continued completions to reconstruct the full response.
6. Log token usage & cost from each retry.

#### E) Optional: Telemetry & Alerts

* Track counts of retried calls and total cost per rescue.
* Raise alert if rescue calls exceed acceptable thresholds.

### One-Page Checklist for Your Script

| Step | Action                                                                                        |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Query logs for calls with `finish_reason == "length"` and high cost.                          |
| 2    | For each such call, fetch `/generation/{id}`.                                                 |
| 3    | Compare server-side completion to client received version.                                    |
| 4    | If server-side truncated, rebuild completion via chained requests (client-side continuation). |
| 5    | Set `"usage.include": true` to measure cost.                                                  |
| 6    | Repeat until response isn’t truncated; combine outputs.                                       |
| 7    | Log total tokens, cost, and final complete output.                                            |
| 8    | Add telemetry on rescued calls and costs; optionally raise alerts.                            |
