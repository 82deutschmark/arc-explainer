 * PURPOSE: Capture the in-depth review of the Grover ARC Python solver so we understand its architecture, logging, and how to integrate its outputs into our TypeScript pipeline.
 * SRP/DRY check: Pass - No existing document covers Grover Python internals; scoped to one investigation.

# Grover Python Project Deep Dive

## What the Python Solver Does
- `solver/grover-arc/solver.py:107` runs five iterative refinement passes. Each pass:
  - Generates visual summaries (`prompts.py:20`, `prompts.py:62`).
  - Synthesizes a new program with full prompt context (`prompts.py:104`).
  - Executes that program on all training grids and the first test grid (`dsl_executor.py:301`).
  - Summarizes and grades the attempt (`prompts.py:133`) and appends it to `prev_attempts`.
- The loop sorts attempts by grade so the latest prompts see best attempts last (`solver.py:152`).
- A bug exits early once two summaries hit 10/10—even if the test grid is wrong (`solver.py:183`), so runs stop prematurely.

## Execution & Logging Pipeline
- Programs execute inside `dsl_executor.py`:
  - `execute_dsl_on_problem` saves the generated Python source (`dsl_executor.py:244`).
  - Each training/test execution logs `=== Execution Success ===` plus the raw grid (`dsl_executor.py:219`).
  - PNG snapshots named `train_prediction_#_<seq>.png` / `test_prediction_#_<seq>.png` accompany those outputs (`dsl_executor.py:285`).
  - `Execution Summary` blocks record match booleans for train/test (`dsl_executor.py:367`).
- Logs live under `solver/grover-arc/logs/<puzzle>/<timestamp>` created by `util.py:create_log_directory`. Each directory contains:
  - `log.txt` with prompt/response transcripts, execution summaries, and attempt grades.
  - `generated_program_<time>.py` files capturing programs per attempt.
  - Input/output/prediction images for provenance.

## What We Can Recover from Logs
- Every attempt’s training/test grids and the exact Python source.
- Summaries with `MARK ATTEMPT GRADE` to identify high-quality runs.
- Because predictions are logged as plain JSON in `log.txt`, we can script backfill into our DB (`Select-String` shows the grids around `Execution Success` blocks).
- Test matches rarely hit `True`; this solver pipeline stops when training succeeds but test fails, so downstream consumers must re-run best programs on the real test set.

## Integration Gaps in Our TypeScript Service
- `GroverService.buildGroverResponse` never executes the best program on test inputs, so it returns `predictedOutput = null`.
- The controller saves that stub response directly (`groverController.ts:66`), bypassing validators; the DB row lacks grids, correctness, or multi-test metadata.
- We already have a Python sandbox (`pythonBridge.runGroverExecution`) but Grover never uses it for tests.

## Recommended Actions
1. After the Python solver identifies `bestProgram`, call the sandbox on each test input and populate `predictedOutput`, `multiplePredictedOutputs`, and `multiTestResults`.
2. Feed those grids through `responseValidator` before persisting so accuracy metrics are consistent with other solvers.
3. Script a log parser to backfill historical Grover runs: read the last `Execution Success` + `Execution Summary` pair, attach the associated `test_prediction` PNG, and seed the DB.
4. Fix the early-exit condition in `solver.py` so the Python solver only reports success when test outputs are verified.
