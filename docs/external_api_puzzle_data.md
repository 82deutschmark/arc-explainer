# How to Retrieve All Data for a Specific Puzzle

This document outlines the process for an external application to query the Arc-Explainer API and retrieve all available information for a specific puzzle, using its unique ID.

**ðŸ”„ Recent API Changes:** As of January 2025, API result limits have been significantly increased for external applications. See changelog for details.

**Example Puzzle ID:** `e7dd8335`

To get a complete picture of a puzzle, you will need to make multiple API calls to different endpoints. Each endpoint provides a specific slice of the data associated with the puzzle.

## 1. Core Puzzle Data

This is the primary endpoint to get the fundamental puzzle data, including the training and test grids.

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/puzzle/task/:taskId`
*   **Description:** Retrieves the core task data for a single puzzle.
*   **Returns:** A JSON object containing the puzzle's `train` and `test` arrays, which define the input/output grids.

**Example Request:**
```
GET /api/puzzle/task/e7dd8335
```

## 2. AI-Generated Explanations

This endpoint retrieves all explanations that have been generated by various AI models for the puzzle.

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/puzzle/:puzzleId/explanations`
*   **Description:** Retrieves an array of all explanation records stored for the specified puzzle ID.
*   **Returns:** A JSON array where each object is a detailed explanation, including the model used, the predicted output, confidence scores, pattern descriptions, and more.

**Example Request:**
```
GET /api/puzzle/e7dd8335/explanations

## 3. User Feedback

This endpoint provides all user-submitted feedback associated with the puzzle's explanations.

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/puzzle/:puzzleId/feedback`
*   **Description:** Retrieves all feedback records linked to a specific puzzle ID.
*   **Returns:** A JSON array of feedback objects. This includes votes (`helpful` or `not_helpful`) and textual comments.

**Example Request:**
```
GET /api/puzzle/e7dd8335/feedback
```
