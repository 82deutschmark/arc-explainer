# Streaming Modal UX Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Much Larger Modal Size
**Problem:** Modal was too small (max-w-3xl) for the large amount of streaming text output.

**Solution:** 
- Increased to `max-w-[95vw] max-h-[90vh]` (95% viewport width/height)
- Uses nearly full screen for maximum visibility

**File:** `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx` line 457

### 2. No Auto-Close on Completion
**Problem:** Modal closed automatically after streaming completed, too fast for users to read results.

**Solution:**
- Added `closeStreamingModal()` function to `useAnalysisResults` hook
- Added `onClose` prop to `StreamingAnalysisPanel` component
- Shows manual "Close" button when status is 'completed' or 'failed'
- User must click "Close" button to dismiss modal

**Files:**
- `client/src/hooks/useAnalysisResults.ts` - Added closeStreamingModal function
- `client/src/components/puzzle/StreamingAnalysisPanel.tsx` - Added Close button UI
- `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx` - Wired up onClose callback

### 3. Increased Text Area Sizes
**Problem:** Text areas were too small (max-h-40 / max-h-32) causing excessive scrolling.

**Solution:**
- Current Output: `max-h-[500px]` (12.5x larger)
- Reasoning: `max-h-[400px]` (12.5x larger)
- Added `font-mono` class for better readability
- Both areas scroll independently when content exceeds height

**File:** `client/src/components/puzzle/StreamingAnalysisPanel.tsx` lines 87, 94

## UI Flow

### Before
1. User starts streaming analysis
2. Small modal appears inline
3. Text areas tiny, lots of scrolling
4. **Modal auto-closes on completion** ‚Üê User can't review results
5. User must refresh page to see saved result

### After
1. User starts streaming analysis
2. **Large modal appears (95% of screen)**
3. **Big text areas with individual scrolling**
4. **Modal stays open on completion**
5. **User sees "Close" button**
6. User reviews results at their own pace
7. User clicks "Close" when ready
8. Results already saved in database

## Testing
