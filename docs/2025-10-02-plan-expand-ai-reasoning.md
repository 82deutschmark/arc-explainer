# Plan: Expand AI Reasoning Panel

- **Goal**: Ensure the AI Reasoning section within AnalysisResultCard renders expanded by default for faster insight review.
- **Context**: Current card toggles reasoning via showReasoning, defaulting to collapsed; we need to respect SRP by adjusting state without altering other toggles.
- **Approach**:
  - Audit existing state flags to confirm no derived effects from showReasoning default.
  - Update initialization so the reasoning accordion opens on first render while keeping toggle behavior intact.
  - Validate UI logic and document header compliance with repository standards.
- **Deliverables**: Updated AnalysisResultCard.tsx with required file header metadata and expanded reasoning panel default.
