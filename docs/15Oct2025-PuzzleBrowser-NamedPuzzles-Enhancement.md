# Puzzle Browser Named Puzzles Enhancement

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Author:** DeepSeek V3 (Windsurf Cascade)

## Overview

Enhanced the puzzle browser landing page to prominently display and highlight the 400 named ARC puzzles with visual grid previews, making them more discoverable and engaging.

## Key Changes

### 1. New `PuzzleCard` Component
**File:** `client/src/components/puzzle/PuzzleCard.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Named puzzles show friendly names prominently** (e.g., "fractal", "honeypots", "beanstalk")
- **Lazy-loaded grid previews** using intersection observer for performance
- **Shows first training example** (input → output) as visual preview
- **Consistent styling** with redesigned landing page
- **Professional hierarchy:** Name → ID → Grid Preview → Status → Actions

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `TinyGrid` component for grid rendering
- Fetches puzzle data only when card becomes visible (viewport + 100px margin)
- Falls back gracefully if grid data fails to load
- Supports showing/hiding grid preview via prop

### 2. Named Puzzle Filtering
**File:** `client/src/pages/PuzzleBrowser.tsx`

**New Filter:**
- "Puzzle Names" dropdown with options:
  - All Puzzles
  - **Named Only (400 puzzles)** ← highlights the count
  - Unnamed Only

**Quick Stats Update:**
- Now shows: `X puzzles | Y named | Z analyzed`
- Named count displayed prominently in hero section

### 3. Sort by Named Puzzles
**New Sort Option:** "Named First"
- **Default sort** is now "Named First" to highlight these puzzles
- Named puzzles appear first, then unnamed
- Secondary sort by puzzle ID for consistency

### 4. Integration with Existing System
**Imports from:**
- `@shared/utils/puzzleNames` - 400 puzzle name mappings
  - `getPuzzleName(id)` - Get friendly name
  - `hasPuzzleName(id)` - Check if puzzle has a name
  - `PUZZLE_NAMES` - Complete mapping

**Grid Components:**
- `TinyGrid` - Renders color grids with CSS Grid
- Supports dynamic sizing and aspect ratios
- Uses official ARC color palette

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ 007bbfb7        │
│ Not analyzed    │
│ 30×30 Variable  │
│ [Examine]       │
└─────────────────┘
```

### After
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ fractal         │ ← Friendly name (capitalized)
│ 007bbfb7        │ ← ID for reference
│ ┌────┬────┐     │
│ │ In │→Out│     │ ← Visual grid preview
│ └────┴────┘     │
│ Not analyzed    │
│ 30×30 Variable  │
│ [Examine Puzzle]│
└─────────────────┘
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading:** Grid data fetched only when card enters viewport
2. **Intersection Observer:** 100px rootMargin for smooth preloading
3. **Silent Failures:** Cards degrade gracefully if grid fetch fails
4. **Component Memoization:** filteredPuzzles memoized with proper dependencies

## Code Quality

### SRP Compliance
- `PuzzleCard.tsx` - Single responsibility: render puzzle card with optional grid
- `puzzleNames.ts` - Single responsibility: puzzle name mapping
- `TinyGrid.tsx` - Single responsibility: render ARC grids

### DRY Principle
- Grid rendering logic centralized in `TinyGrid`
- Puzzle name utilities centralized in `@shared/utils/puzzleNames`
- Card rendering extracted from inline code to reusable component

## Files Modified

1. **Created:**
   - `client/src/components/puzzle/PuzzleCard.tsx` (165 lines)
   - `docs/15Oct2025-PuzzleBrowser-NamedPuzzles-Enhancement.md` (this file)

2. **Modified:**
   - `client/src/pages/PuzzleBrowser.tsx`
     - Added `namedFilter` state
     - Added "Named First" sort option
     - Updated quick stats to show named count
     - Replaced inline card rendering with `PuzzleCard` component
     - Updated imports and dependencies

## Statistics

- **400 named puzzles** out of ~1200 total
- **Named puzzle examples:** fractal, honeypots, beanstalk, tilt, stamp, intersect, etc.
- **Grid preview:** Shows first training example (input/output pair)
- **Performance:** Lazy loads ~400 grids instead of loading all upfront

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing:**
   - Verify named puzzles show names prominently
   - Check grid previews render correctly
   - Test hover states and transitions

2. **Performance Testing:**
   - Scroll through 400+ puzzles - should be smooth
   - Verify grids load only when visible
   - Check memory usage doesn't explode

3. **Filter Testing:**
   - "Named Only" filter should show 400 puzzles
   - "Unnamed Only" should show remaining puzzles
   - Filters should combine correctly

4. **Sort Testing:**
   - "Named First" should prioritize named puzzles
   - Verify secondary sort by ID works
   - Test other sort options still work

## Future Enhancements

1. **Name search:** Allow searching by friendly name (e.g., "fractal")
2. **Name categories:** Group by name patterns (colors, shapes, actions)
3. **Hover tooltips:** Show full name + ID on hover
4. **Grid size controls:** Let users show/hide grid previews globally
5. **Popular puzzles:** Track which named puzzles are most viewed
