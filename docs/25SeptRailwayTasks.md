# Railway Deployment Data Persistence Issue - 25 September 2025

## 🚨 **Critical Problem Identified**

Your ARC Explainer application has a **fundamental data loss issue** in production deployments on Railway.

## 📋 **The Problem**

### **Current Behavior (Broken)**
- ✅ **Local development**: Raw JSON logs saved to `data/explained/` persist between runs
- ❌ **Railway production**: Same logs saved to ephemeral filesystem, **lost on every deployment**

### **Why This Happens**
Railway uses **ephemeral containers** by default:
- Container restarts = fresh filesystem
- Your `data/explained/` directory starts empty
- Expensive AI responses disappear forever
- No recovery mechanism in production

### **Impact**
- 💸 **Lost money**: Failed database saves waste API costs
- 📊 **Lost data**: No analytics on model performance
- 🔄 **Lost recovery**: Can't retry failed analyses
- 🐛 **Lost debugging**: No way to troubleshoot production issues

## 🎯 **The Solution: Railway Persistent Volumes**

### **What You Need**
Configure a **persistent volume** in Railway to store your logs permanently.

### **Step 1: Create railway.toml Configuration**

Create or update your `railway.toml` file in the project root:

```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"

# Add persistent volume for logs and data
[[volumes]]
source = "arc_explainer_data"
destination = "/app/data"

# Optional: Environment-specific settings
[deploy.env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### **Step 2: Deploy with Persistent Storage**

1. **Commit the railway.toml file** to your repository
2. **Push to trigger deployment** - Railway will detect the new volume configuration
3. **Railway will create** a persistent volume named `arc_explainer_data`
4. **Mount it at** `/app/data` in your container

### **Step 3: Verify the Fix**

After deployment, check:

```bash
# SSH into your Railway container
railway shell

# Check if data directory persists
ls -la /app/data/
ls -la /app/data/explained/

# Test with a simple file
echo "test" > /app/data/test.txt
railway shell  # New shell session
cat /app/data/test.txt  # Should still exist
```

## 🔧 **What This Fixes**

### **Before (Broken)**
```
API Call → AI Analysis → Save to /app/data/explained/ → Database Save Fails
→ Container Restart → /app/data/ wiped → Logs lost forever
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```
API Call → AI Analysis → Save to /app/data/explained/ → Database Save Fails
→ Container Restart → /app/data/ persists → Logs still available
→ Run recovery → Data recovered to database
```

## 📊 **Benefits You'll Get**

1. **💰 Cost Recovery**: Retry failed database saves instead of losing money
2. **📈 Analytics**: Complete model performance data for all puzzles
3. **🐛 Debugging**: Full production logs for troubleshooting
4. **🔄 Reliability**: Never lose expensive AI responses
5. **📋 Recovery**: `npm run recover` works in production too

## ⚡ **Immediate Action Required**

1. **Create** `railway.toml` with the volume configuration above
2. **Deploy** to test the persistent storage
3. **Verify** logs persist across container restarts
4. **Monitor** your Railway dashboard for the new volume

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Fix**

Once persistent storage is working:

1. **Deploy your analysis scripts** - they can now run safely in production
2. **Monitor storage usage** - Railway volumes have quotas
3. **Consider cloud storage** - for very large datasets (AWS S3, etc.)
4. **Set up log rotation** - prevent storage from growing indefinitely

## 📞 **Railway Support**

If you encounter issues:
- **Railway Docs**: https://docs.railway.app/deploy/volumes
- **Railway CLI**: `railway volume --help`
- **Railway Dashboard**: Check "Volumes" tab in your project

**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Must fix before production deployment
**Priority**: 🚨 **HIGHEST** - Data loss occurring
**Impact**: 💸 **High financial impact** - Wasted API costs
