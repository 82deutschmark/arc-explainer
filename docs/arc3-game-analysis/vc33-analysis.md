# VC33: Volume Control - Intel & Strategy

## Game Overview
- **Game ID**: `vc33`
- **Official Title**: Volume Control
- **Category**: Preview
- **Difficulty**: Medium

## Core Mechanics
- **Hydraulic System**: White columns behave like a closed liquid/water system.
- **Controllers**: Clicking Red or Blue squares shifts the "volume" between columns.
- **Player Interaction**: Player squares (Yellow, Green, Purple) are not directly controllable. They sit atop the "liquid" columns and rise/fall with them.
- **Movement**: Players automatically move horizontally when the vertical height of the columns aligns with an open gate/door.

## Proven Strategies
- **Volume Balancing**: Raising one column effectively lowers others in the same "circuit".
- **Top-Down Transit**: Use the hydraulics to lift players to the correct elevation for their specific exit gates.

## Questions for Refining Strategy
1. **Saturation Limits**: What happens if a player square is pushed against the ceiling by the rising hydraulic liquid? Does the liquid stop, or is there a "crush" state?
2. **Circuit Isolation**: Is the grid a single unified hydraulic tank (one click affects everything), or are there isolated sub-systems (e.g., Red button A only affects Columns 1 and 2)?
