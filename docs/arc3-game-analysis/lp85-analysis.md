# LP85: Loop & Pull - Intel & Strategy

## Game Overview
- **Game ID**: `lp85`
- **Official Title**: Loop & Pull
- **Category**: Evaluation
- **Difficulty**: Hard

## Core Mechanics
- **Target Indicators**: Four small yellow squares act as the designated slots for the alignment of larger yellow blocks.
- **Controls**: Red and Green buttons. 
- **Action Logic**: While primary actions involve looping, advanced buttons can trigger **Swaps**, **Pushes**, or **Pulls**.
- **Goal**: Perfect overlay of large yellow blocks onto all small yellow indicator squares.

## Proven Strategies
- **Slot Alignment**: Prioritize identifying where the small yellow squares are (these are the "anchors"). Use them as the target coordinates for pathfinding.
- **Button Experimentation**: On turn 1 of an advanced level, test each unique color/shape button to classify it as a Looper, Swapper, or Pusher.

## Questions for Refining Strategy
1. **Swap Range**: When a button triggers a "Swap," does it affect the entire loop (reversing the order) or only a specific pair of blocks adjacent to each other?
2. **Push/Pull Resolution**: If a "Push" button is clicked and the block hits a target, does it stop, or will it continue through the target until it hits the loop's boundary?
