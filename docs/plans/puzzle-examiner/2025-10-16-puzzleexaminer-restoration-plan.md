# PuzzleExaminer Restoration Plan (2025-10-16)

## Objective
Restore the PuzzleExaminer page to the previous card-based layout and re-enable the streaming explanation dialog regression.

## Context Review
- Inspect current implementation in `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx`.
- Compare against historical versions prior to list layout regression.
- Identify components removed or replaced (card layout, streaming dialog).

## Tasks
1. Review git history for `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx` and related components to locate card-based implementation and streaming dialog logic.
2. Extract or recreate missing UI components (cards, streaming dialog trigger, modal) while adhering to current hooks/services.
3. Update `PuzzleExaminer.tsx` to reinstate card layout for model list and restore streaming dialog functionality.
4. Ensure supporting components (if any) are imported and functional.
5. Test locally via component-level reasoning (no runtime execution required) and update documentation/comments if necessary.

## Deliverables
- Updated `PuzzleExaminer.tsx` (and supporting components if needed) with restored functionality.
- Commit summarizing restoration steps.
