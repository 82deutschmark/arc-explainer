# Plan: Streaming Active Endpoints (Abandoned)

## Target Endpoints (never landed)
- `GET /api/stream/analyze/:taskId/:modelKey` (analysis SSE) ? – controller/service committed in `8203973`
- `GET /api/stream/saturn/:taskId/:modelKey` ? – controller/route missing after botched restore
- `GET /api/stream/grover/:taskId/:modelKey` ? – never implemented

## State After Failure
- Analysis SSE path works for PuzzleExaminer/Discussion/Debate (committed work)
- Saturn streaming service file (`server/services/streaming/saturnStreamService.ts`) exists but is untracked/uncommitted (content lost, needs restoration)
- Hooks/clients referencing Saturn streaming (`useSaturnProgress`) removed by restore and must be recovered
- Grover streaming integration never started

## Recovery Guidance
1. Follow recovery checklist in `docs/2025-10-10-plan-sse-analysis-integration.md`
2. Once Saturn streaming is restored, implement Grover SSE using same blueprint
3. Update this doc with completion status or delete once new plan supersedes it
