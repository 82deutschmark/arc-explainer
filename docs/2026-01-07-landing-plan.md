Ideas are needed. 

The designer agent needs to search the project for the various art assets and things that we have. I guess for now the best idea would be what we currently have on the landing page, but split into two slices. So it's like "Choose your Path," Arc 1&2 or Arc 3. And then, so we'll do ARC1&2 on the left side, and on the right side, we'll have a little miniature of the replay of an ARC 3 game. That should be pretty easy for you to do; it just involves converting that.jsonl file to an mp4 file or something. You'll have to think through it and figure out. 

Get to work on writing a plan and put it here. Replace this with your plan.
