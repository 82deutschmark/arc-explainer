# 22AugUIFix â€” UI/UX Plan for Puzzle Examiner


the model predicted answer section of the UI, it is always a light green background, can we turn it to light red if the model is wrong? make a plan and follow it.and yes the puzzle examiner is fixed! I'd like a comprehensive redesign of this page to make it more compact.  it is essentially speading 10 lines of info over an entire screen.  drop the padding.  I want the whole "AI Model Analysis
Test how different AI models try to explain why this solution is correct" changed because it is 10x larger than it should be.  the "Complete Puzzle Pattern
Training examples show the pattern, test case shows the question and correct answer" is likewise awful and HUGE.  it should correctlz state that it is the training and test grids for task ID whatever.  and wherever "Examining alien communication pattern" that text needs to go.  that's incorrect, it should just be something about testing LLMs ARC-AGI performance ultrathink and come up with a comprehensive redesign to make the @PuzzleExaminer.tsx more compact without losing any functionality.
