No immediate trap is forced and the opponent is too far to contest the apple quickly.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Continue down the x=1 column toward (1,4) to collect the nearby apple.\n- Avoid moving left into column x=0 (my own body) \u2014 prefer continuing down or stepping right if necessary.\n- After getting (1,4), reassess: head toward remaining apples (3,3) or 1,0 depending on space and opponent actions.
