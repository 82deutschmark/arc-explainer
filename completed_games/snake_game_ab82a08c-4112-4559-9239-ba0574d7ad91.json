This advances directly toward the easy, uncontested apple at (1,9) while keeping multiple escape routes open.

That funnels me immediately.\n- RIGHT to (4,8) leaves multiple safe continuations (UP to 4,9, RIGHT to 5,8, DOWN to 4,7 all appear free), so it preserves more escape options and avoids immediate funneling toward the top edge.\n- Enemy head is far on the right; a single step right does not create a risky head-on with them now. Staying flexible is important to avoid getting boxed by their long body line near y=6.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT now to keep options open.\n- From there prefer to move upward/rightward space if safe, avoid being funneled to the top edge, and then swing left/down toward the (0,5) apple when a safe path opens. Reassess after enemy moves each turn.\n\nRIGHT",

There\u2019s no apple there, and the enemy is far away, so this is the valid choice to stay alive this turn. After this move, the next turn may force a difficult situation due to your body layout, but you must survive this turn first.\n\nPlan:\n- Take DOWN now, then reassess safety and apple access on subsequent turns.
