Fix: Model comparison architecture - eliminate DRY/SRP violations

PROBLEM: Model comparison returning 0 or incomplete results when comparing models on specific datasets.

ROOT CAUSE: DRY and SRP violations in dataset puzzle ID retrieval.
- MetricsRepository had its own implementation using puzzleLoader with source mapping
- ModelDatasetRepository had correct filesystem-based implementation (private)
- puzzleLoader uses priority-based deduplication (wrong semantic for model comparison)
- Model comparison needs ALL puzzles in directory, not priority-filtered subset

THE BUG: When dataset has 120 puzzles but 20 also exist in higher-priority dataset,
puzzleLoader returns only 100 (excludes 20 due to priority) while filesystem approach returns all 120 (correct).

FIX:
1. Made ModelDatasetRepository.getPuzzleIdsFromDataset() PUBLIC (canonical API for dataset operations)
2. Updated MetricsRepository.getPuzzleIdsForDataset() to delegate (removed puzzleLoader logic)
3. Updated documentation in both repositories

BENEFITS: Correctness, SRP compliance, DRY compliance, better maintainability

FILES: MetricsRepository.ts, ModelDatasetRepository.ts, 2 analysis docs

VERIFIED: No breaking changes - API contract unchanged, isolated fix
