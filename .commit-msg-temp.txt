feat: Grover snapshot hydration for instant progress display

PROBLEM:
- Grover page showed nothing for 30-60 seconds, then everything appeared at once
- Reloading mid-run lost all progress, showing blank cards
- Users had no feedback that analysis was running

ROOT CAUSE:
- No snapshot hydration: UI waited for first WebSocket message
- If early progress fired before socket ready, nothing rendered until much later
- Page reload had no way to recover state from running session

SOLUTION:
Implemented dual-path snapshot hydration mirroring Saturn pattern:

1. Immediate Hydration After Start
   - Fetch snapshot right after receiving sessionId
   - Hydrate state before WebSocket connects
   - Prevents blank screen during socket connection delay
   - Lines 116-136 in useGroverProgress.ts

2. Reload Hydration
   - Poll snapshot on mount if sessionId exists but state is empty
   - Rehydrates progress after page reload mid-run
   - Lines 307-337 in useGroverProgress.ts

BACKEND:
- Endpoint already existed: GET /api/grover/status/:sessionId (line 172 routes.ts)
- groverController.getStatus uses wsService.getSessionSnapshot (lines 131-139)
- No backend changes needed

IMPACT:
- Progress visible within 1-2 seconds instead of 30-60 seconds
- Iteration cards update incrementally, not in final burst
- Page reload preserves all progress via snapshot
- Active iteration highlighting works immediately

VERIFICATION:
- Start run: Header shows "initializing/iteration_start" within 1-2s
- Activity stream logs appear immediately
- Iteration cards update as data arrives
- Reload mid-run: State rehydrates from snapshot

FILES MODIFIED:
- client/src/hooks/useGroverProgress.ts (snapshot hydration implementation)
