Fix critical UX issues in PuzzleDiscussion and CompactPuzzleDisplay

CRITICAL FIXES:

1. Navigation Bug - Refine This Analysis badge now correctly auto-selects explanation
   - Added isLoadingExplanations guard to prevent race condition
   - Added error toast for missing or ineligible explanations
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies for proper auto-selection

2. Grid Aspect Ratio Bug - Removed aspect-square constraint destroying non-square grids
   - PredictionCard forced all grids into squares (1x30 became square)
   - Now uses natural aspect ratios with max-w and max-h constraints
   - Grids properly display in their actual dimensions

UI IMPROVEMENTS:

3. Typography - Increased font sizes from 8-9px to 10-11px for readability
4. Spacing - Reduced excessive gaps (gap-10 to gap-6, gap-8 to gap-4)
5. Refinement History - Redesigned section with horizontal scroll, Brain icon, stronger visual separation
