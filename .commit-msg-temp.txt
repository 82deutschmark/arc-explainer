Author: Cascade using Claude Sonnet 4.5

CHANGES:

1. Removed ConversationChainViewer Component
   - Deleted component with hardcoded fake token calculations
   - Lines 65, 78, 81, 84 had fabricated numbers (~500 tokens, fake math)
   - Removed import from GroverSolver.tsx

2. Enhanced Grover UI Clickability
   - Start Analysis button: Large gradient (blue->purple), bold shadows
   - Back button: Added text label, outline variant, clear hover states
   - GitHub link: Thicker borders, better visual prominence
   - Program cards: Full-width buttons with 2px borders, color-coded backgrounds
   - Best program: Green gradient background, star badge
   - Expand/collapse: 8x8 colored state indicator boxes
   - All interactive elements: Clear shadows, hover effects, state feedback

3. Fixed WebSocket State Management Bug
   - Log-only messages no longer overwrite status with stale errors
   - Progress phases (prompt_ready, waiting_llm, etc.) force status to 'running'
   - Prevents status getting stuck on 'error' when process is working
   - Fixed in useGroverProgress.ts lines 208-227

FILES MODIFIED:
- client/src/pages/GroverSolver.tsx (removed ConversationChainViewer, enhanced buttons)
- client/src/components/grover/IterationCard.tsx (program cards UI overhaul)
- client/src/hooks/useGroverProgress.ts (WebSocket state management fix)
