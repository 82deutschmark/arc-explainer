/**
 * DeepSeek Service Integration for ARC-AGI Puzzle Analysis
 * @author Cascade / Gemini Pro 2.5
 * 
 * This service provides integration with DeepSeek's AI models for analyzing ARC-AGI puzzles.
 * It leverages DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities to explain puzzle solutions in the
 * context of alien communication patterns, making abstract reasoning more accessible.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Full compatibility with DeepSeek's REST API using OpenAI SDK
 * - Support for multiple DeepSeek models (deepseek-v3, deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner)
 * - Structured JSON output for consistent puzzle explanations
 * - Emoji-based interpretation for accessibility and engagement
 * - Creative alien communication framing for educational purposes
 * 
 * Model Capabilities:
 * - DeepSeek V3: Latest reasoning model with advanced capabilities
 * - DeepSeek Chat: Conversational model optimized for dialogue
 * - DeepSeek Reasoner: Specialized reasoning model for complex problems
 * 
 * API Integration:
 * - Uses OpenAI SDK with base URL https://api.deepseek.com
 * - Requires DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable
 * - Fully compatible with existing puzzle analysis pipeline
 * - Maintains same interface as other AI services for seamless integration
 * 
 * Educational Context:
 * The service frames ARC-AGI puzzles as alien communication challenges, where:
 * - Numbers 0-9 are mapped to meaningful emojis
 * - Transformations represent alien logical concepts
 * - Solutions reveal the "meaning" of alien messages
 * - Explanations focus on WHY answers work, not just HOW to solve
 * 
 * This approach makes abstract reasoning more intuitive and accessible,
 * especially for users with colorblindness or neurodivergent thinking patterns.
