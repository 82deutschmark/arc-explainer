/**
 * xAI Grok Service Integration for ARC-AGI Puzzle Analysis
 * Supports reasoning log capture for Grok reasoning models (grok-4-0709)
 * These models provide reasoning logs similar to OpenAI reasoning models
 * @author Cascade / Gemini Pro 2.5
 * 
 * This service provides integration with xAI's Grok models for analyzing ARC-AGI puzzles.
 * It leverages Grok's advanced reasoning capabilities to explain puzzle solutions in the
 * context of alien communication patterns, making abstract reasoning more accessible.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Full compatibility with xAI's REST API using OpenAI SDK
 * - Support for multiple Grok models (beta, 3, 3-mini, 4, 4-mini)
 * - Intelligent handling of reasoning vs non-reasoning model limitations
 * - Structured JSON output for consistent puzzle explanations
 * - Emoji-based interpretation for accessibility and engagement
 * - Creative alien communication framing for educational purposes
 * 
 * Model Capabilities:
 * - Grok Beta: Preview model with 128k context, vision support
 * - Grok 3/3-mini: Standard reasoning models with temperature control
 * - Grok 4/4-mini: Latest reasoning models (no temperature/penalty support)
 * 
 * API Integration:
 * - Uses OpenAI SDK with base URL https://api.x.ai/v1
 * - Requires GROK_API_KEY environment variable
 * - Fully compatible with existing puzzle analysis pipeline
 * - Maintains same interface as OpenAI service for seamless integration
 * 
 * Educational Context:
 * The service frames ARC-AGI puzzles as alien communication challenges, where:
 * - Numbers 0-9 are mapped to meaningful emojis
 * - Transformations represent alien logical concepts
 * - Solutions reveal the "meaning" of alien messages
 * - Explanations focus on WHY answers work, not just HOW to solve
 * 
 * This approach makes abstract reasoning more intuitive and accessible,
 * especially for users with colorblindness or neurodivergent thinking patterns.
