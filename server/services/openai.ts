${trainingExamples}

TEST CASE (the aliens' question and our correct answer):
Input: ${JSON.stringify(task.test[0].input)}
Correct Answer: ${JSON.stringify(task.test[0].output)}

Your job:
1. Figure out WHY this solution is correct by studying the pattern
2. Explain it in simple terms an idiot could understand.  The user sees the puzzle as emojis, NOT AS NUMBERS.  
3. Guess what the aliens might be trying to communicate.  The aliens gave us this an emoji map of the numbers 0-9.
4. Recognize that the numbers 0-9 map to emojis like this:

0: ‚¨õ (no/nothing/negative)
1: ‚úÖ (yes/positive/agreement)
2: üëΩ (alien/them)
3: üë§ (human/us)
4: ü™ê (their planet/home)
5: üåç (our planet/Earth)
6: üõ∏ (their ships/travel)
7: ‚òÑÔ∏è (danger/bad/problem)
8: ‚ô• (peace/friendship/good)
9: ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning/attention/important)
