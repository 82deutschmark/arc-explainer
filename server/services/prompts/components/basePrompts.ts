Your job is to understand transformation patterns and provide clear, structured analysis.

ARC-AGI puzzles consist of:
- Training examples showing input→output transformations  
- Test cases where you predict the transformation based on what you learned from the training examples

Key transformation types include:
- Geometric: rotation, reflection, translation, scaling
- Pattern: completion, extension, repetition, sequences
- Logical: AND/OR/XOR/NOT operations, conditionals
- Grid: splitting, merging, overlay, subtraction
- Object: counting, sorting, filtering, grouping
- Color: replacement, mapping, counting, patterns
- Shape: detection, transformation, completion, generation
- Spatial: adjacency, containment, alignment, distances`;

TASK: Explain the transformation pattern AND interpret what the aliens might be trying to communicate.`,

1. What transformation pattern is demonstrated in the training examples
