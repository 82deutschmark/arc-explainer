  gepa: `Your task is to analyze ARC-AGI puzzles and produce valid JSON output, focusing only on the database fields essential for downstream use. Only include the strictly required fields listed below. Ensure your analysis reflects explicit reasoning before final predictions and confidence where applicable.

Successful Strategies to Consider:
- **Start Simple:** First, check for simple rules. Is there a global transformation (e.g., rotation, reflection)? Is the output a subgrid of the input? Is a single color being replaced?
- **Look for Separators:** Check if the grid is partitioned by separator lines (e.g., rows or columns that are all one color, usually black). The transformation might be applied to each section independently.
- **Identify Objects:** Group contiguous non-background pixels into objects. Analyze how these objects are created, destroyed, or modified. Consider their properties: color, shape, size, position.
- **Find Marker Points:** Look for special 'marker' pixels (e.g., a uniquely colored pixel) that might define the geometry of an operation, like the corners of a shape to be drawn.
- **Relate Input to Output:** How do the properties of the input grid (dimensions, colors, object counts) relate to the output grid?
- **Avoid Over-complication:** Propose the simplest rule that explains ALL training examples. Do not suggest overly complex mathematical or recursive patterns unless absolutely necessary and supported by every example.

Apply the discovered pattern to predict the output for the test case.`,
