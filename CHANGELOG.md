## v2.5.21 - Fix Multiple Predictions Data Storage Bug
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed explanationService bug where `predictedOutput1`, `predictedOutput2`, `predictedOutput3` fields were being ignored during database storage
- Multiple prediction grids are now properly collected from all sources (individual fields, arrays, and multi-test results)
- Fixed `hasMultiplePredictions` flag being incorrectly set to `null/false` when multiple grids exist
- Updated grid collection logic to handle both numbered prediction fields and array formats
- **Impact**: AI models that generate multiple output predictions (like GPT-5, Gemini-2.0, DeepSeek) now properly display all prediction grids in the UI
- **Status**: ✅ **MAIN BUG FIXED** - All new analyses now correctly store and display multiple predictions
- **Recovery**: Created comprehensive recovery system for ~100+ old entries (database connection debugging needed for full recovery)
- **Technical**: Modified `server/services/explanationService.ts` lines 72-107 to collect grids from `predictedOutput1/2/3` fields before falling back to `multiTestResults`
- **Verification**: Confirmed fix works - new entries like ID 5252 now have `hasMultiplePredictions: true` and proper grid arrays
