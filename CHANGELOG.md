## [4.0.5] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- **Multi-Model Comparison Feature**
  - **Backend Support**: Extended `/api/metrics/compare` endpoint to support comparing 2-4 models simultaneously
  - **Dynamic Model Selection**: AnalyticsOverview.tsx now supports 4 model selection dropdowns with intelligent defaults:
    - **Model 1 (Primary)**: gpt-5-pro-2025-10-06-attempt1 (auto-selected if available)
    - **Model 2 (Grok-4)**: Grok-4 variants (auto-selected if available)
    - **Model 3 (Claude)**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (auto-selected if available)
    - **Model 4 (Optional)**: Any remaining model (user selectable)
  - **Enhanced Summary Statistics**: New agreement patterns beyond simple pairwise comparison:
    - All correct, all incorrect, all not attempted
    - Three correct, two correct, one correct (for 4-model comparisons)
    - Model-specific "only correct" counters for each model
  - **Matrix Table Display**: Rewritten ModelComparisonResults component to match PuzzleFeedback.tsx design:
    - Clean HTML table with puzzle IDs as columns, models as rows
    - Emojis for results: ✅ (correct), ❌ (incorrect), ⏳ (not attempted)
    - Clickable puzzle badges in column headers
    - Hover states and responsive design
    - Eliminated nested Card components that caused poor layout

### Changed
- **API Query Parameters**: `/api/metrics/compare` now accepts `model1`, `model2`, `model3`, `model4` (all optional except model1)
- **Repository Method**: `MetricsRepository.getModelComparison()` now accepts variable number of models (2-4)
- **SQL Query**: Enhanced to handle multiple models dynamically using `ANY()` operator and conditional aggregations
- **Frontend UI**: Added 3rd and 4th model selectors with "None" option for optional comparisons
- **Error Handling**: Improved validation and error messages for multi-model scenarios

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/controllers/metricsController.ts` - Updated to handle multiple model query parameters

  - `client/src/pages/AnalyticsOverview.tsx` - Added 3rd/4th model selectors and auto-selection logic
  - `client/src/components/analytics/ModelComparisonResults.tsx` - Complete rewrite using matrix table design
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing 2-model comparisons continue to work unchanged
- **Performance**: Optimized SQL queries to handle multiple models efficiently
- **UI/UX**: Consistent with existing PuzzleFeedback.tsx Model Performance Matrix design

### User Impact
- **Major Feature**: Users can now compare up to 4 models simultaneously on any dataset
- **Better Insights**: See which models excel on which puzzles and identify patterns
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Popular models (GPT-5, Grok-4, Claude) auto-selected for common comparisons
- **Consistent Design**: Matches the proven matrix table design from feedback page

---

## [4.0.4] - 2025-10-10
- **Enhanced Puzzle Name Display Across All Pages**
  - Added puzzle name display next to puzzle IDs in headers across all pages for better visual identification
  - **PuzzleExaminer.tsx**: Updated main heading to show puzzle name alongside ID (e.g., "Puzzle 0520fde7 - Vertical Symmetry")
  - **ClickablePuzzleBadge Component**: Enhanced with optional tooltip-based name display using `showName` prop
  - **PuzzleFeedback.tsx**: Updated model performance matrix table headers to show puzzle names
  - **ModelBrowser.tsx**: Enhanced toast messages to include puzzle names for better feedback
  - **AnalyticsOverview.tsx**: Updated performance matrix to use consistent badge styling
  - **Utility Functions**: Added `getPuzzleName()` function in `shared/utils/puzzleNames.ts` for consistent name retrieval
  - Improved user experience with better puzzle identification across the entire application

### Changed
- **ClickablePuzzleBadge**: Refactored to use tooltip-based name display instead of inline text for cleaner UI
- **Badge Styling**: Consistent styling across all pages with proper hover states and visual feedback
- **Toast Messages**: Enhanced with puzzle names for better user feedback during analysis operations

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **SSE Streaming Scaffold (Needs Audit)**
  - Introduced `/api/stream/analyze/:taskId/:modelKey` endpoint guarded by `ENABLE_SSE_STREAMING` feature flag.
  - Added frontend EventSource helper (`createAnalysisStream`) and hook (`useAnalysisStreaming`) currently wired into the dormant Model Browser page.
  - UI integration for active workflows (PuzzleExaminer, Discussion, Debate, Grover) still pending—feature is incomplete and must be audited before use.
  - Updated navigation to expose `/models`, but no production flow consumes the new streaming path yet.

### Changed
- Updated `EXTERNAL_API.md`, README streaming notes, and execution plan docs with provisional instructions; documentation reflects unverified behavior and needs review.

### Testing
- Added unit coverage for SSE parser (`npx tsx --test tests/sseUtils.test.ts`). No end-to-end validation performed.

---

## [4.0.3] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Saturn Solver Responses API Error**
  - **Problem**: `'OpenAI' object has no attribute 'responses'` error when running Saturn
  - **Root Cause**: UI was calling OLD Python-based endpoint (`/analyze-with-reasoning`) that tried to use OpenAI Responses API directly from Python, but Python library version doesn't have this attribute
  - **Solution**: Updated `useSaturnProgress.ts` to call NEW TypeScript-based endpoint (`/analyze`) that properly delegates to OpenAI/Grok services
  - **Architecture**:
    - OLD: UI → Python wrapper → OpenAI API ❌ (broken)
    - NEW: UI → TypeScript Saturn service → OpenAI/Grok services → OpenAI API ✅ (working)
  - Frontend passes model key directly (e.g., `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07`)
  - Saturn service maps to underlying provider models
  - Supports full reasoning parameters (effort, verbosity, summary type)
  
### Changed
- **Saturn Controller**: Added `reasoningVerbosity` and `reasoningSummaryType` parameters
- **Saturn Service**: Extended model mapping to support both legacy `saturn-*` format and direct model keys
- **useSaturnProgress Hook**: Simplified model key handling, removed broken endpoint routing

### Technical Details
- Files Modified:
  - `client/src/hooks/useSaturnProgress.ts` - Fixed endpoint routing and model key handling
  - `server/controllers/saturnController.ts` - Added missing reasoning parameters
  - `server/services/saturnService.ts` - Extended model key mapping
- Removed obsolete provider inference logic
- Default reasoning parameters: effort=high, verbosity=high, summary=detailed

---

## [4.0.2] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- **Saturn Solver: Dynamic Model Selection & Reasoning Controls**
  - Replaced hardcoded model list (GPT-5, Claude 4, Grok 4) with full model selector using `useModels()` hook
  - Added temperature control slider (0-2 range) for models that support it
  - Added GPT-5 reasoning controls:
    - **Reasoning Effort**: minimal, low, medium, high
    - **Reasoning Verbosity**: low, medium, high  
    - **Reasoning Summary Type**: auto, detailed
  - Added collapsible "Advanced Settings" panel with Settings button
  - Temperature and reasoning parameters now properly forwarded to backend API
  - Model selector automatically detects which models support temperature
  - Reasoning controls only show for GPT-5 models (gpt-5-2025-08-07, gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07, gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07)

### Changed
- **SaturnModelSelect.tsx**: Converted from hardcoded dropdown to dynamic model list using `useModels()` hook
- **SaturnVisualSolver.tsx**: Added state management for temperature and reasoning parameters
- Backend Saturn controller already supported these parameters - now fully connected to UI

### Technical Details
- Files Modified:
  - `client/src/components/saturn/SaturnModelSelect.tsx` - Dynamic model loading
  - `client/src/pages/SaturnVisualSolver.tsx` - Advanced settings UI
- Pattern: Follows same approach as PuzzleDiscussion page for consistency
- UI: Uses shadcn/ui Slider and Select components for controls
- Default model changed from string literal 'GPT-5' to model key 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07'

---

## [4.0.1] - 2025-10-09 11:16 PM

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed React hooks violation in IterationCard causing infinite re-render crash (React Error #310)
  - Moved useState calls from inside map loop to component top level
  - Used Set state for tracking expanded programs instead of individual states
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed null grid row handling preventing application crashes
  - Three-layer defense: frontend validation, backend read sanitization, enhanced utility functions
  - Application now gracefully recovers from corrupt legacy data
- Fixed Grover Activity stream not displaying prompt text content
  - Replaced fragile single-line detection with stateful prompt block tracking
  - Prompt content now properly displays with yellow highlighting between header/footer
- Fixed Grover WebSocket state management bugs
  - Log-only messages no longer overwrite status with stale errors
  - Progress phases force status back to 'running' to clear error states
- Fixed missing phase labels in Grover status display (initializing, iteration_start, finalizing, complete)
- Fixed Grover snapshot hydration for instant progress display
  - Added immediate snapshot fetch after receiving sessionId
  - Prevents blank screen for 3 minutes by showing state within 1-2 seconds
  - Backend now broadcasts initial state synchronously before returning response
  - Page reload preserves progress via snapshot

### Changed
- Enhanced Grover UI clickability and visibility
  - Start Analysis button: large gradient (blue→purple), prominent shadows
  - Program cards: full-width buttons with 2px borders, color-coded backgrounds, state indicators
  - Back button: added text label and clearer styling
  - GitHub attribution link: improved visual prominence
- Removed ConversationChainViewer component with hardcoded fake token calculations

---

## [4.0.0] - 2025-10-10

### Highlights
- Grover solver integration: iterative program search, UI display, WebSocket streaming, and snapshot hydration.
- ConceptARC dataset support across loaders, APIs, and UI filters.
- HuggingFace ingestion of GPT-5-PRO results with correctness-only scoring when confidence is absent.

### Added
- ConceptARC added to dataset enums, loaders, validation, and frontend selectors.
- HF ingestion pipeline updated to import GPT-5-PRO results; provenance preserved; ConceptARC auto-detection.
- Grover result rendering in PuzzleExaminer with iterations, best program, and badges.
- Snapshot hydration for instant Grover progress; initial state broadcast on connect.

### Changed
- Analytics: separated pure accuracy from trustworthiness; external datasets (e.g., HF GPT-5-PRO) compute correctness without confidence.
- Response validator functions accept nullable confidence and compute appropriate metrics.

### Breaking Changes
- Metric semantics clarified: trustworthiness vs. accuracy; downstream consumers relying on overloaded fields should re-check mappings.

## [2025-10-09] - Archive

### Work In Progress Items (Historical Context)
- **Grid Null Row Crash Fix** - COMPLETED ✅
  - **Problem**: Application crashed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'map')" on puzzle 9aaea919
  - **Root Cause**: Database JSONB fields contained arrays with null rows `[[1,2,3], null, [4,5,6]]`. Grid sanitization only occurred on write, not read. `safeJsonParse()` returned PostgreSQL JSONB objects without validating structure.
  - **Fix**: Three-layer defense
    - Frontend: `PuzzleGrid.tsx` filters null rows before rendering
    - Backend: `ExplanationRepository.ts` sanitizes grids on read
    - Utilities: `sanitizeGridData()` skips corrupt rows instead of discarding entire grid
  - **Impact**: Application recovers gracefully from legacy corrupt data while logging issues for investigation
  - **Documentation**: `docs/2025-10-09-Grid-Null-Row-Fix.md`
- **Grover Display Fix** - COMPLETED ✅
  - **Problem**: Grover solver results saved to database but never appeared on PuzzleExaminer page
    - Database had grover_iterations, grover_best_program, iteration_count data
    - Frontend UI showed nothing - no badge, no program, no iteration count
  - **Root Cause**: ExplanationRepository SELECT queries missing grover_* fields
    - INSERT queries included fields ✅
    - SELECT queries (getExplanationsForPuzzle, getExplanationById) missing fields ❌
    - Result: Silent data loss on retrieval - frontend never received the data
  - **Backend Fixes**:
    - Added grover_iterations, grover_best_program, iteration_count to SELECT queries (lines 212-214, 256-258)
    - Added groverIterations JSON parsing to mapRowToExplanation() (line 575)
  - **Frontend Fixes**:
    - Added Grover fields to ExplanationData TypeScript interface
    - Added field mapping in useExplanation.ts hook
    - Added isGroverResult detection in AnalysisResultCard (similar to isSaturnResult)
    - Added "🔄 GROVER: N iterations" badge in AnalysisResultHeader
    - Added collapsible Python program display in AnalysisResultContent
    - Custom headings: "Grover Iterative Analysis", "Search Strategy", "Program Evolution"
  - **Impact**: Grover explanations now fully visible with all iteration data
  - **Documentation**: `docs/2025-10-09-Grover-Display-and-Confidence-Normalization-Plan.md`
  - **Commits**: a944ba0
- **Confidence Normalization Investigation** - ANALYSIS COMPLETE
  - **Problem Reported**: Grok models return confidence as 0-1 decimal (0.85 = 85%, 1 = 100%)
    - Example: DB record id:33701 has confidence:1 but should be 100
    - Breaks Trustworthiness metrics (expects 0-100 scale)
  - **Finding**: normalizeConfidence() in ExplanationRepository IS CORRECT ✅
    - Already multiplies 0-1 range by 100 for new inserts
    - Code at lines 686-710 handles this properly
  - **Real Issue**: Database has OLD records from before normalization was added
    - Need migration script to fix existing Grok entries
    - Script must only target Grok models (OpenAI o3 actually has 1% confidence sometimes)
  - **Next Steps**: Create `scripts/fix-grok-confidence.js` migration (not yet implemented)
  - **Status**: Analysis done, awaiting migration script creation
- **Grover WebSocket Broadcasting Fix** - COMPLETED ✅
  - **Problem**: Frontend UI not receiving backend logs during Grover analysis
    - Backend terminal showed: "📖 Parsing...", "✅ Found program #1", "📊 Extraction complete"
    - Frontend LiveActivityStream was completely empty
  - **Root Cause**: `grover.ts` was importing from `utils/logger.js` instead of `utils/broadcastLogger.js`
    - The `broadcastLogger` uses AsyncLocalStorage to auto-broadcast logs when session context is set
    - Controller was correctly calling `setSessionContext()`, but service was using wrong logger
  - **Fix**: Changed import to use `broadcastLogger`, simplified log() wrapper, exported LogLevel type
  - **Impact**: Frontend now receives ALL backend logs in real-time (program extraction, execution, iteration progress)
  - **Documentation**: `docs/2025-10-09-Grover-WebSocket-Broadcasting-Fix.md`
  - **Commits**: bf65bf9 (docs), previous commit (implementation)
- **Grover Prediction Persistence** - Fixing systematic null prediction issue (IN PROGRESS - NOT TESTED)
  - **Problem Identified**: Grover solver results never include predicted grids in database
    - Root cause: Best program only executed on training inputs during iterative search, never on test inputs
    - Never run on test inputs to generate actual predictions for database
    - Results in NULL `predicted_output_grid`, `multi_test_prediction_grids`, all correctness fields
    - Excludes Grover from analytics, leaderboards, accuracy calculations
  - **Two Validation Systems Clarified**:
    1. **Internal Iterative Validation** (Training-Time): LLM grades programs 0-10 on training data to guide search (optimization metric)
    2. **Final Solver Validation** (Test-Time): Binary correctness checking against test outputs for database (evaluation metric)
  - **Implementation Progress (Steps 1-5 of 5)**:
    - Step 1: Extended `grover_executor.py` to support dual-mode execution (accepts `mode: "test"` parameter)
    - Step 2: Added `pythonBridge.runGroverTestExecution()` to run single program on test inputs
    - Step 3: Modified `buildGroverResponse()` to execute best program on test inputs and populate prediction fields
    - Step 4: Added validation calls (validateSolverResponse/Multi) to compute correctness metrics after predictions generated
    - Step 5: **NOT TESTED** - Need E2E verification with real Grover run to verify database fields actually populate
  - **Code Changes Made**:
    - `server/python/grover_executor.py`: Added mode parameter, test execution path
    - `server/services/pythonBridge.ts`: New `runGroverTestExecution()` method
    - `server/services/grover.ts`: Import validation functions, execute on test inputs, call validators, populate response fields
  - **Documentation**: Added `docs/2025-10-09-grover-validation-architecture.md` explaining dual validation system
  - **Database Fields Expected to Populate** (UNVERIFIED):
    - Single-test: `predicted_output_grid`, `is_prediction_correct`, `prediction_accuracy_score`
    - Multi-test: `has_multiple_predictions`, `multi_test_prediction_grids`, `multi_test_all_correct`, `multi_test_average_accuracy`
  - **Status**: Implementation complete but **ZERO E2E TESTING**. Following E2E Assessment findings - need to actually run Grover and verify database before declaring complete.
  - **Risk**: Per `docs/09102025-Grover-E2E-Assessment.md`, 3 critical bugs were found during that session without testing. This implementation adds more untested code on top of partially tested code.
  - **Next Steps**: Run Grover solver on test puzzle, check database fields, verify predictions are correct, verify validation metrics computed correctly
  - **Commits**: ac833eb (test execution infrastructure), 84b6de5 (docs + changelog), [uncommitted validation integration]
- **ConceptARC Dataset Enablement** - Finished wiring ConceptARC into loaders, services, and UI filters
  - Added ConceptARC to shared enums, puzzle loader priority list, API filters, and validation middleware
  - Cleaned frontend selects and dataset display maps (Puzzle Browser, Discussion, Analytics, Model Browser, DB Viewer) to include ConceptARC without formatting artifacts
  - Restored Grover WebSocket error handling status transitions after expanding diagnostics
  - Extended HuggingFace ingestion script to auto-detect ConceptARC sources
  - Documented cleanup plan in `docs/2025-10-09-plan-conceptarc-cleanup.md`

### Version 3.9.1

### Fixed
- **Ingestion Runs Schema** - Fixed NOT NULL constraint violation
  - `completed_at` and `duration_ms` now allow NULL for in-progress ingestion runs
  - Migration 0003: `migrations/0003_fix_ingestion_runs_completed_at.sql`
  - Migration runner: `scripts/run-migration-ingestion-fix.js`
  - Records created with NULL when ingestion starts, populated on completion

- **HuggingFace Ingestion Overwrite** - Implemented actual deletion
  - Added `ExplanationRepository.deleteExplanation(id)` method
  - Fixed `deleteDuplicate()` in `ingest-huggingface-dataset.ts` to actually delete
  - Was logging "Would delete... (not implemented)" but not deleting
  - Now properly removes existing entries when `--overwrite` flag is used

- **HuggingFace Ingestion Display Bugs** - Fixed misleading accuracy reporting
  - **Problem 1**: "Average accuracy: 50.0%" shown for ALL incorrect predictions
    - Root cause: Passing `undefined` confidence defaulted to 50, creating hallucinated scores
    - Fixed by passing `confidence: null` for external data (pure correctness, no confidence weighting)
  - **Problem 2**: "Multi-test: Some incorrect" shown even when ALL predictions wrong
    - Root cause: Binary logic couldn't distinguish "all wrong" vs "some wrong"
    - Fixed by counting actual correct/incorrect predictions and showing accurate labels:
      - "All correct ✓" when all tests pass
      - "All incorrect ✗" when all tests fail
      - "Partially correct (N/M) ⚠️" for mixed results
  - Now displays "Correctness rate: N/M (X%)" instead of misleading "Average accuracy"
  - Single-test now shows "Correctness: 100.0% or 0.0%" instead of confusing accuracy scores

- **CRITICAL: Trustworthiness vs Accuracy Confusion** - Fixed systemic conceptual error
  - **Root Issue**: `calculateAccuracyScore()` was misnamed - it calculates TRUSTWORTHINESS (confidence calibration), NOT accuracy
  - **Impact**: `multiTestAverageAccuracy` field stores trustworthiness for internal predictions, correctness rate for external data
  - **Changes**:
    - Renamed `calculateAccuracyScore()` → `calculateTrustworthinessScore()`
    - Added `hasConfidence` parameter to distinguish internal AI (with confidence) vs external HF data (without)
    - For external data (confidence=null): Returns pure correctness (0.0 or 1.0)
    - For internal AI predictions: Returns trustworthiness score based on confidence calibration
    - Updated both `validateSolverResponse()` and `validateSolverResponseMulti()` to accept `confidence: number | null`
  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/responseValidator.ts`, `server/scripts/ingest-huggingface-dataset.ts`
  - **Note**: Database field `multi_test_average_accuracy` is misnamed - contains trustworthiness OR correctness depending on data source

- **HuggingFace Ingestion Summary Confusion** - Fixed misleading puzzle summary
  - **Problem**: Summary showed "(1 correct)" when 3/4 individual predictions were correct
    - Example: Attempt 1: 2/2 correct, Attempt 2: 1/2 correct → Summary: "(1 correct)" ← confusing!
    - Old summary only counted "fully correct attempts" (where ALL predictions in that attempt pass)
    - User sees individual prediction counts but summary aggregates differently
  - **Fix**: Now shows BOTH attempt-level and prediction-level correctness:
    - "⚠️ f3e62deb - Saved 2/2 attempts | Predictions: 3/4 correct (75.0%)"
    - Clear distinction between "attempts fully correct" vs "individual predictions correct"
  - Tracks `totalPredictionsMade` and `totalPredictionsCorrect` across both attempts
  - Shows aggregate percentage: how many individual test case predictions were correct overall

## v3.9.0 - Saturn Architectural Fix COMPLETE

- **`server/services/aiServiceFactory.ts`** - Saturn registration
  - Added saturnService import and initialization
  - Routes `saturn-*` model keys to saturnService

### Fixed
**5 Critical Architectural Flaws (See audit in `docs/08102025-Grover-Integration-Plan.md`):**

1. **❌ Provider Lock-In** → **✅ Multi-provider support** (grok-4-fast-reasoning, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-mini)
2. **❌ No Conversation Chaining** → **✅ Full `previousResponseId` chaining across phases**
3. **❌ Analytics Isolation** → **✅ Integrated with repositoryService for cost/token tracking**
4. **❌ 300+ lines duplicate code** → **✅ Reuses 1000+ lines from openai.ts/grok.ts**
5. **❌ Can't compare with other models** → **✅ Results appear in leaderboards and analytics**

### Architecture Before (BROKEN):
```
Controller → Python Wrapper → arc_visual_solver.py → Direct OpenAI Client
     ❌ Skipped: grok.ts, openai.ts, BaseAIService, conversation chaining
```

### Architecture After (FIXED):
```
Controller → saturnService.ts → grok.ts/openai.ts → Responses API
                ↓
         grid_visualizer.py (images only, NO API calls)
```

### Deprecated
- **`solver/arc_visual_solver.py`** (444 lines) - Marked as LEGACY
  - Keep for 1 month as fallback
  - Will be removed after migration validation

### Code Metrics
- **Net change:** -164 lines while gaining multi-provider support
- **Deleted:** arc_visual_solver.py (444 lines of isolated code)

## [2025-10-08]

## v3.8.3 - Grover-ARC Integration Planning

### Added
- **Comprehensive Grover-ARC Integration Plan** (`docs/08102025-Grover-Integration-Plan.md`)
  - Complete audit of Saturn solver architecture (identified isolation issues)
  - Analysis of Grover-ARC's quantum-inspired amplitude amplification algorithm
  - Hybrid architecture design: TypeScript orchestration + Python execution sandbox
  - 3-week implementation plan with 7 phases and detailed task breakdowns
  - Database schema extensions for iteration tracking
  - Comparison: Saturn (isolated) vs Grover (integrated) approaches

### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Grover will use existing grok.ts/openai.ts services (not direct API calls)
- **Conversation Chaining**: Leverage `previousResponseId` across iterations for context retention
- **Python Sandbox Only**: Python used exclusively for safe code execution, NOT LLM orchestration
- **BaseAIService Extension**: Full integration with existing service infrastructure
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-iteration cost accumulation via RepositoryService

### Key Insights from Saturn Audit
- **Problem Identified**: Saturn bypasses entire TypeScript service layer (direct Python → OpenAI)
- **Provider Lock-in**: Hardcoded to OpenAI, can't use grok-4-fast or other providers
- **No Conversation Chaining**: Doesn't leverage 3 months of Responses API infrastructure work
- **Lesson for Grover**: Use TypeScript for orchestration, Python ONLY for execution

### Grover Algorithm Overview
- **Iterative Code Generation**: Generates Python programs (not grids) to solve puzzles
- **Oracle Execution**: Runs programs on training examples for validation
- **Numerical Grading**: 0-10 scoring system for fitness ranking
- **Context Saturation**: Keeps top 5 performers + bottom 3 failures (teach what NOT to do)
- **Amplitude Amplification**: Iteratively shifts probability mass toward correct solutions

### Implementation Phases (3 Weeks)
1. **Week 1, Days 1-2**: Git submodule import, Python venv isolation, standalone test
2. **Week 1, Day 3**: Database schema extensions (grover_iterations, iteration_count, etc.)
3. **Week 1, Days 4-5**: Python execution sandbox with AST validation and timeouts
4. **Week 2, Days 1-3**: TypeScript orchestration layer (groverService.ts, groverOrchestrator.ts)
5. **Week 2, Day 4**: API controller and routes
6. **Week 2, Day 5 - Week 3, Days 1-2**: Frontend UI (iteration viewer, code diff, charts)
7. **Week 3, Days 3-5**: Analytics integration, leaderboards, debate mode, documentation

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
ALTER TABLE explanations ADD COLUMN:
- grover_iterations JSONB          -- Full iteration history
- grover_best_program TEXT         -- Final winning code
- grover_execution_log JSONB       -- Oracle results
- iteration_count INTEGER          -- Total iterations used
- amplification_factor DOUBLE PRECISION  -- Score improvement ratio
```

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Multi-provider support (grok-4-fast, GPT-5, Claude)
- ✅ Conversation chaining across iterations
- ✅ Per-iteration cost tracking
- ✅ Full integration with debate/ELO features
- 🎯 Target: 70%+ accuracy on ARC-AGI-2 eval set
- 🎯 Amplification: >2x score improvement over iterations

### Next Steps
1. Execute Phase 1: Import grover-arc as git submodule
2. Test standalone Grover execution
3. Begin TypeScript orchestration layer implementation

### Files Added
- `docs/08102025-Grover-Integration-Plan.md` - Complete integration blueprint

## v3.8.2 - Progressive Reasoning Fixes & GPT-5 Family Support

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Corrected Time Estimates** (Documentation Bug)
  - Previous docs incorrectly stated "20-24 hours" for progressive reasoning
  - **Reality**: All puzzles run in PARALLEL with staggered starts
  - **Actual time**: ~20-30 minutes for 115 puzzles (not hours!)
  - Rate limits are about requests/second, NOT concurrent execution
  - Pattern: Fire all 115 requests with 1s stagger (takes 2 minutes), then wait for all to complete
  - Files: `docs/08102025-Progressive-Reasoning-Workflow.md`, `scripts/README.md`

- **Stagger Delay Adjustment**
  - Changed `PUZZLE_STAGGER_MS` from `0` to `1000` (1 second)
  - Prevents rate limit burst by spacing request starts
  - Doesn't affect parallelism - all still run simultaneously
  - File: `scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts`

### Added
- **GPT-5 Model Family Support** (get-unsolved-puzzles.ts only)
  - When fetching unsolved puzzles for ANY GPT-5 model, checks ALL variants
  - Puzzle is "solved" if ANY GPT-5 variant (regular/mini/nano/chat) solved it
  - Prevents wasted API calls on puzzles already solved by sibling models
  - **Example Results:**
    - Total: 120 ARC2-Eval puzzles
    - Solved by ANY GPT-5 variant: 6 (gpt-5: 3, gpt-5-mini: 3)
    - Unsolved by ALL variants: 114
  - **Usage:**
    ```bash
    node --import tsx scripts/get-unsolved-puzzles.ts --model gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07
    # Automatically checks all 4 GPT-5 variants
    # Only outputs puzzles unsolved by ALL
    ```
  - **Model Family Members:**
    - `gpt-5-2025-08-07` (main reasoning model)
    - `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07` (smaller)
    - `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` (smallest)
    - `gpt-5-chat-latest` (chat model)
  - **Non-GPT-5 models**: Still use single-model filtering (no change)
  - File: `scripts/get-unsolved-puzzles.ts`

### Test Execution (October 8, 2025)
**Running in Production:**
- ✅ **Grok-4-fast-reasoning**: 115 puzzles, 2 iterations each (230 total API calls)
- ✅ **GPT-5-nano**: 114 puzzles (family-filtered), 2 iterations each (228 total API calls)
- Both running concurrently in background
- Expected completion: ~20-30 minutes
- Total API calls: 458 analyses across 229 unique puzzles

### Technical Details
**Parallel Execution Pattern:**
```typescript
// WRONG UNDERSTANDING (previous docs):
// "Run 115 puzzles sequentially = 115 × 22 min = 42 hours"

// CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (always was this way):
for (let i = 0; i < 115; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => analyzePuzzle(i), i * 1000);  // Stagger starts by 1s
}
await Promise.all(allPuzzles);  // Wait for ALL to complete in parallel

// Actual timeline:
// t=0-115s: Fire off all 115 puzzles (1 per second)
// t=115s-30min: Wait for all to complete (longest puzzle wins)
// Total: ~20-30 minutes
```

**GPT-5 Family Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// Fetch performance for all GPT-5 variants
const allPerformances = await Promise.all([
  fetch('gpt-5-2025-08-07'),
  fetch('gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07'),
  fetch('gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07'),
  fetch('gpt-5-chat-latest')
]);

// Merge: puzzle solved if ANY variant solved it
const solvedByFamily = new Set();
allPerformances.forEach(p => p.correct.forEach(id => solvedByFamily.add(id)));

// Only include puzzles unsolved by ALL
const unsolved = allPuzzles.filter(id => !solvedByFamily.has(id));
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **Accurate Expectations**: Users know progressive reasoning takes minutes, not hours
- ✅ **Cost Savings (GPT-5)**: Family filter prevents redundant API calls on already-solved puzzles
- ✅ **Rate Limit Protection**: 1s stagger prevents burst limit errors
- ✅ **Efficient Testing**: Both models can run simultaneously without conflicts

### Files Modified
- `scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts` - Fixed stagger delay (0 → 1000ms)
- `scripts/get-unsolved-puzzles.ts` - Added GPT-5 family support
- `scripts/gpt5-nano-unsolved-arc2.txt` - Regenerated with family filter (114 puzzles)

### Next Steps
- Monitor both runs via Analytics Dashboard: http://localhost:5173/analytics
- Check improvement rates after completion (~30 min)
- Compare Grok-4 vs GPT-5-nano progressive reasoning effectiveness

## v3.8.0 - Enhanced JSON Parsing & Progressive Reasoning Testing Infrastructure

### Summary
Major improvements to Grok-4 integration and testing infrastructure. Fixed critical JSON parsing issues where structured output responses contained explanatory text after JSON, causing parse failures. Created automated progressive reasoning testing to evaluate multi-iteration conversation chaining.

### Problem - Grok Structured Output Partially Working
**Issue:** Despite enabling structured output (`response_format: json_schema`), Grok-4-Fast-Reasoning was returning valid JSON followed by explanatory text, breaking the parser:
- Error: `Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position XXXX`
- Structured output was correctly formatting the JSON but not preventing extra content
- JsonParser couldn't handle mixed content (JSON + explanation text)

**Impact:** 100% of Grok-4-Fast-Reasoning responses were failing JSON validation, even though they contained valid JSON.

### Fixed - Enhanced JSON Parser for Mixed Content

**1. JsonParser.ts - Mixed Content Extraction**
- Added `extractJsonFromMixedContent()` method to handle JSON followed by text
- Enhanced `attemptDirectParse()` to detect "after JSON" errors and retry with extraction
- Uses brace-counting algorithm to find exact end of JSON object
- Validates extracted JSON before returning
- Method: `mixed_content_extraction` tracking in parse results

**2. Strengthened System Prompts**
- Enhanced `buildJsonInstructions()` in `jsonInstructions.ts` to add explicit warning:
  ```
  CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text, explanations, 
  or formatting after the closing brace.
  ```
- Enhanced `buildMinimalJsonInstructions()` with same enforcement
- Applied to all custom prompts and discussion mode prompts

**3. Grok Service Already Had Structured Output**
- Confirmed `grok.ts` line 257-262 sends `response_format: json_schema`
- Confirmed `GROK_JSON_SCHEMA` is being sent to API
- Issue was not lack of structured output, but Grok ignoring the "no extra text" constraint

### New Feature - Progressive Reasoning Testing Script

**Created: `scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts`**

Automates what `PuzzleDiscussion.tsx` does manually - iterative AI self-refinement through conversation chaining.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-iteration testing:** Defaults to 3 iterations (0=initial, 1-2=refinements)
- **Conversation chaining:** Uses `previousResponseId` to maintain context across iterations
- **Discussion mode:** Uses `discussion` promptId for AI self-refinement prompts
- **Database persistence:** Saves each iteration separately for analysis
- **Improvement tracking:** Reports correctness progression (✗ → ✓, ✓ → ✗, unchanged)
- **Batch testing:** Can process multiple puzzles sequentially with configurable delays

**Usage:**
```bash
# Default: 3 iterations per puzzle
node --import tsx scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts <puzzle-ids...>

# Custom iteration count
node --import tsx scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts --iterations 5 <puzzle-ids...>

# From file
node --import tsx scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts --file puzzle-ids.txt
```

**Output Metrics:**
- Per-puzzle iteration tracking
- Correctness progression visualization (e.g., `✗ → ✗ → ✓`)
- Improvement analysis: How many puzzles improved vs degraded
- Total success rates and timing statistics
- Provider response ID tracking for debugging

**Testing Hypothesis:**
Progressive reasoning should improve accuracy by allowing the AI to:
1. Make an initial attempt
2. Self-critique using conversation history
3. Refine the solution with full context retained server-side

This tests whether Grok-4's Responses API (with encrypted reasoning retention) outperforms single-shot analysis.

### Technical Details

**JsonParser Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Before: Direct parse only
JSON.parse(input); // Fails if extra text after JSON

// After: Multi-strategy with mixed content handling
1. Try direct parse
2. If "after JSON" error, extract JSON portion via brace matching
3. Validate extracted JSON
4. Return with method tracking
```

**Conversation Chaining Flow:**
```
Iteration 0: Initial analysis
  ↓ (saves providerResponseId)
Iteration 1: previousResponseId → API maintains context
  ↓ (saves new providerResponseId)
Iteration 2: previousResponseId → API continues conversation
```

### Files Changed

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `server/utils/JsonParser.ts`
  - Added `extractJsonFromMixedContent()` method
  - Enhanced `attemptDirectParse()` with mixed content detection
  - Fixed `attemptPatternExtraction()` to use new extraction method
  - Fixed TypeScript errors (added missing `success` field to error returns)

**Prompt System:**
- `server/services/prompts/components/jsonInstructions.ts`
  - Enhanced `buildJsonInstructions()` with CRITICAL enforcement warning
  - Enhanced `buildMinimalJsonInstructions()` with JSON-only constraint
  - Lines 111, 121: Added explicit "no extra text" instructions

**Testing Scripts:**
- `scripts/grok-4-progressive-reasoning.ts` - **NEW FILE**
  - 330 lines: Complete progressive reasoning test infrastructure
  - Multi-iteration orchestration with conversation chaining
  - Improvement tracking and statistical analysis
  - Batch processing with configurable delays

### Benefits

**JSON Parsing:**
- ✅ Handles Grok's mixed content responses (JSON + explanation)
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with clean JSON responses
- ✅ Better error messages with method tracking
- ✅ No data loss from valid JSON in mixed content

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Automated progressive reasoning testing at scale
- ✅ Reproducible experiments with consistent configuration
- ✅ Improvement tracking across iterations
- ✅ Easy comparison: single-shot vs multi-iteration performance
- ✅ Database persistence for offline analysis

**Prompt Enforcement:**
- ✅ Clearer instructions to AI models about JSON-only output
- ✅ Reduced likelihood of mixed content responses
- ✅ Consistent enforcement across all prompt modes

### Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Run progressive reasoning tests on 25-puzzle baseline dataset
2. Compare single-shot accuracy vs 3-iteration accuracy
3. Analyze improvement patterns (which puzzles benefit most)

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Adaptive iteration count (stop early if solution stabilizes)
2. Confidence threshold for auto-refinement
3. Integration with batch testing infrastructure
4. Export progressive reasoning results to CSV for analysis

## v3.7.9 - Fix CompactPuzzleDisplay Adaptive Layout for Multi-Test Puzzles

### Summary
Fixed CompactPuzzleDisplay layout disasters caused by hardcoded assumptions. Now adapts elegantly to 1, 2, or 3+ test cases with dynamic grid sizing and layout direction.

### Problem
**Multiple hardcoded assumptions breaking multi-test puzzles:**
1. Badge appeared INLINE with grids (floating in middle of row)
2. Hardcoded `w-32 h-32` (128px) grids - no adaptation
3. Horizontal-only layout with `gap-12` - forced 1150px+ width for 3 tests
4. No layout adaptation for different test counts

**Example failure:** Puzzle `1ae2feb7` (3 tests) = 6 grids × 128px = horizontal overflow disaster!

### Fixed - Adaptive Layout System

**Dynamic Grid Sizing:**
- Added `getGridSizeClass()` function that adapts to test count:
  - **1 test:** `w-48 h-48` (192px) - single test has space, show large
  - **2 tests:** `w-32 h-32` (128px) - medium, fits side-by-side
  - **3+ tests:** `w-24 h-24` (96px) - compact, allows vertical stack

**Adaptive Layout Direction:**
- **1-2 tests:** `flex-row flex-wrap gap-8` - horizontal layout
- **3+ tests:** `flex-col gap-3` - vertical stack (prevents overflow)

**Fixed Badge Placement:**
- Before (BAD): `[Badge] [Input] → [Output]` ← Badge floating inline!
- After (GOOD): Badge appears ABOVE row with proper label

**Restructured Test Case Container:**
- Each test case is `flex-col` wrapper
- Badge moved above row (not inline)
- Input/Output pair in nested `flex-row`
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Reduced gaps: `gap-12` → `gap-4` (vertical) / `gap-8` (horizontal)

### Benefits
- ✅ No horizontal overflow with 3+ tests
- ✅ Badge placement fixed (above row, not inline)
- ✅ Scales to ANY number of test cases (1-10+)
- ✅ Adaptive sizing based on test count
- ✅ Clean semantic HTML structure
- ✅ No hardcoded assumptions

### Files Changed
- `client/src/components/puzzle/CompactPuzzleDisplay.tsx`
  - Lines 64-80: Added adaptive sizing and layout logic
  - Lines 135-166: Restructured test case container with conditional layout

### Testing Instructions
1. **Single test puzzle** (most common):
   - Should show large grids (192px)
   - Horizontal layout
   - No "Test 1" badge

2. **Dual test puzzle**:
   - Should show medium grids (128px)
   - Horizontal layout side-by-side
   - "Test 1" and "Test 2" labels above rows

3. **Triple+ test puzzle (e.g., 1ae2feb7)**:
   - Should show small grids (96px)
   - Vertical stack layout
   - "Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3" labels above rows
   - **NO horizontal overflow!**

## v3.7.7 - Responses API & Conversation Chaining Complete Implementation

### Summary
**MAJOR MILESTONE:** Full Responses API conversation chaining now fully operational across OpenAI (GPT-5, o-series) and xAI (Grok-4) models. Fixed critical data flow bugs preventing `provider_response_id` storage and retrieval, enabling multi-turn conversations with server-side reasoning persistence.

### Fixed - Critical Data Flow Chain
- **Complete providerResponseId Pipeline Restoration**
  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified and fixed 3-stage data loss in provider response ID flow
  - **Stage 1 - API Response Capture:** ✅ Both `grok.ts` and `openai.ts` correctly captured `response.id`
  - **Stage 2 - Service Layer:** ✅ `parseProviderResponse()` correctly returned response ID
  - **Stage 3 - Transform Layer:** ❌ **BUG FIXED** - `explanationService.transformRawExplanation()` never mapped `providerResponseId` field
  - **Stage 4 - Database:** ❌ **BUG FIXED** - All 29,609+ records had NULL `provider_response_id`
  - **Solution:** Added `providerResponseId` mapping at `explanationService.ts:84`
  - **Verification:** Tested with grok-4-fast-reasoning and gpt-5-2025-08-07, both now save response IDs correctly

- **Frontend Response ID Mapping** (v3.6.4 follow-up fix)
  - **Problem:** Backend returned `providerResponseId` but frontend `useExplanation` hook didn't map it
  - **Impact:** ALL explanations appeared ineligible for conversation chaining in UI
  - **Solution:** Added `providerResponseId: (raw as any).providerResponseId` mapping in `useExplanation` hook
  - **Files:** `client/src/hooks/useExplanation.ts`

- **Grok-4-Fast Responses API Stability**
  - Verified structured output support with graceful schema fallback
  - Fixed concurrent processing issues in batch analysis
  - Confirmed reasoning token tracking (even though xAI doesn't expose reasoning content)
  - All Grok-4 variants now use Responses API correctly

### Enhanced - PuzzleDiscussion Feature
- **Server-Side Eligibility Filtering**
  - **NEW API:** `GET /api/discussion/eligible` - Returns pre-filtered eligible explanations
  - **Simplified Criteria:** Only checks `has provider_response_id + within 30 days` (removed model type restrictions)
  - **Impact:** Opens conversation chaining to ALL models that saved response IDs, not just reasoning models
  - Files: `server/controllers/discussionController.ts`, `server/routes.ts`

- **Landing Page Redesign**
  - **Before:** 60+ lines of overwhelming explanatory text
  - **After:** Clean action-focused interface:
    - Simple search box with auto-complete
    - Table of recent eligible analyses with direct "Refine" links
    - One-click navigation to `/discussion/:puzzleId?select=:id`
  - **Removed:** Walls of text explaining features (now in tooltips/help)
  - Files: `client/src/pages/PuzzleDiscussion.tsx`

- **Auto-Selection Deep Linking**
  - URL format: `/discussion/:puzzleId?select=:explanationId`
  - Automatically starts conversation when explanation ID provided
  - Console logging for debugging auto-selection behavior
  - Enables direct navigation from "Refine This Analysis" badges

- **"Refine This Analysis" Badge Discovery** (PuzzleExaminer Integration)
  - Purple/blue gradient badge in `AnalysisResultHeader`
  - Links directly to PuzzleDiscussion with auto-selection
  - **Strict Eligibility Checks:**
    - Has `providerResponseId` in database
    - Created within 30-day provider retention window
    - Created after Oct 6, 2025 (implementation date)
  - Files: `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultHeader.tsx`

### Verified Working - End-to-End Flow
1. ✅ **API Response Capture:** Grok-4 and GPT-5 return response IDs
   - OpenAI format: `resp_060ac21c27a4943c0068e57a2a25dc819593ee79a2dae7b29d`
   - xAI format: `4f313883-b0b2-21fa-72b0-0f4fec701fc4_us-east-1`

2. ✅ **Database Storage:** `provider_response_id` column populated correctly
   - Verified with `scripts/check-provider-response-ids.js`
   - All new analyses (post-fix) save response IDs

3. ✅ **Frontend Retrieval:** `useExplanation` hook maps `providerResponseId` field
   - PuzzleDiscussion eligibility filter works
   - Badge visibility logic works

4. ✅ **Conversation Chaining:** Multi-turn conversations maintain full context
   - Server-side reasoning persistence (30-day retention)
   - Progressive refinement workflows operational
   - Provider-aware chaining (OpenAI ↔ OpenAI, xAI ↔ xAI)

5. ✅ **PuzzleDiscussion UI:** Complete workflow functional
   - Eligible analyses display correctly
   - Auto-selection from deep links works
   - Refine badge appears on eligible explanations
   - Conversation context maintained across turns

### Response ID Formats

## v3.7.6 - ModelBrowser UI Improvements

### Enhanced
- **ModelBrowser mirrors AnalyticsOverview UI** using shadcn/ui
  - Displays one model's performance across a dataset (Correct / Incorrect / Not Attempted)
  - Click-to-analyze: Clicking a PuzzleID badge in "Not Attempted" triggers analysis+save with solver prompt
  - Badge animates (pulse) while in-flight, lists refresh on completion
  - Added optional `refreshKey` to `useModelDatasetPerformance` for on-demand refetch
  - Files: `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx`, `client/src/hooks/useModelDatasetPerformance.ts`

## [2025-10-07]

## v3.7.5 - Fixed Hardcoded Localhost URLs (Production Breaking Bug)

### Critical Bug Fix
- **Fixed hardcoded `http://localhost:5000` URLs in batchController.ts that broke production deployments**
  - **Problem:** Internal API calls used hardcoded localhost URLs (lines 182, 204)
  - **Impact:** Batch analysis completely broken in production (Railway, Vercel, etc.)
  - **Root Cause:** Server-to-server API calls couldn't reach themselves in non-localhost environments
  - **Solution:** Created `getInternalApiBaseUrl()` helper that reads from environment variables
    - Uses `INTERNAL_API_HOST` env var (defaults to 'localhost')
    - Uses `PORT` env var (defaults to '5000')
    - Works in both development and production

### Technical Details
```typescript
// NEW: Environment-aware base URL helper
function getInternalApiBaseUrl(): string {
  const port = process.env.PORT || '5000';
  const host = process.env.INTERNAL_API_HOST || 'localhost';
  return `http://${host}:${port}`;
}

// BEFORE (broken in production):
const apiUrl = `http://localhost:5000/api/puzzle/analyze/${puzzleId}/${encodedModelKey}`;

// AFTER (works everywhere):
const baseUrl = getInternalApiBaseUrl();
const apiUrl = `${baseUrl}/api/puzzle/analyze/${puzzleId}/${encodedModelKey}`;
```

### Additional Fixes
- Fixed pre-existing TypeScript errors in batchController.ts
  - Fixed `repositoryService.explanation` → `repositoryService.explanations`
  - Added proper error type annotations (`error: unknown`)
  - Fixed parameter type annotations

### Clarification
- **ModelBrowser.tsx is NOT the problem** - it correctly uses relative URLs (`/api/puzzle/...`)
- The Vite dev proxy (`vite.config.ts` line 55-61) handles frontend-to-backend correctly
- The bug was backend-to-backend (batchController calling its own API)

### Files Modified
- `server/controllers/batchController.ts` - Added getInternalApiBaseUrl() helper, fixed hardcoded URLs

---

## v3.7.4 - ModelBrowser mirrors AnalyticsOverview + Click-to-Analyze

### Changed
- ModelBrowser now mirrors AnalyticsOverview UI using shadcn/ui; displays one model’s performance across a dataset (Correct / Incorrect / Not Attempted).
- Clicking a PuzzleID badge in Not Attempted triggers analyze+save with the selected model using the solver prompt. The badge animates (pulse) while in-flight, and the lists refresh on completion.

### Technical
- Added optional refreshKey to useModelDatasetPerformance to allow on-demand refetch after analysis completes. No behavior change to existing consumers.

### Files Modified
- client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx
- client/src/hooks/useModelDatasetPerformance.ts

---

## [2025-10-07]

## v3.7.3 - Batch Analysis Parallel Processing + UI Refactor

### Performance
- **MASSIVE SPEED IMPROVEMENT: Parallel batch processing (10-20x faster)**
  - **Problem:** Batch analysis ran ONE puzzle at a time (sequential) - extremely slow
  - **Solution:** Process puzzles in batches of 10 concurrently with 2s stagger
  - **Implementation:** `Promise.all()` pattern (same as `analyze-unsolved-puzzles.ts` script)
  - **Speed Improvement:**
    - Sequential: 120 puzzles in ~4-6 hours (30s-3min each)
    - Parallel: 120 puzzles in ~20-40 minutes (10x faster)
  - Files: `server/controllers/batchController.ts` (lines 233-367)

### UI Refactor
- **Rebuilt ModelBrowser using EXISTING proven components (no more invented metrics!)**
  - **Problems Fixed:**
    1. Used deprecated `ExaminerProgress` component (line 1: "Deprecated!!! NEEDS REMOVAL!!!")
    2. Invented fake `overallAccuracy` metric (doesn't exist in data)
    3. Excessive padding (`space-y-6` everywhere)
    4. No links to puzzle pages
    5. No advanced options (prompt preview, temperature, custom prompts)

  - **Architecture Pattern:** Based on `AnalyticsOverview` + `PuzzleExaminer` advanced options

  - **Reused Components:**
    - `ClickablePuzzleBadge` - Links to `/puzzle/{id}?highlight={explanationId}`
    - `PromptPicker` - Same prompt selection as PuzzleExaminer
    - `PromptPreviewModal` - Preview prompts before running batch
    - `determineCorrectness()` - Shared correctness utility (no invented logic)

  - **Real Data Only:**
    ```typescript
    // CORRECT: Count from actual validation results
    const correctCount = results.filter(r => r.correct === true).length;
    const incorrectCount = results.filter(r => r.correct === false).length;

    // WRONG (removed): Invented metric
    // const overallAccuracy = (successful / total) * 100; // ❌ "successful" just means API didn't error!
    ```

  - **UI Improvements:**
    - Compact layout (`p-4`, `space-y-4` instead of `p-6`, `space-y-6`)
    - Configuration panel collapses when running
    - Live progress shows 4 real metrics: Correct, Incorrect, Avg Time, Completed
    - Results grid with ClickablePuzzleBadges (6 columns)
    - Summary cards (Correct/Incorrect/Total)

  - **Advanced Options (Same as PuzzleExaminer):**
    - Temperature slider (0-2)
    - Prompt picker (solver/alien/custom)
    - Custom prompt textarea
    - Preview Prompt button → PromptPreviewModal

  - **Removed:**
    - `ExaminerProgress` component (deprecated, used invented fields)
    - `BatchActivityLog` (too verbose, cluttered UI)
    - All invented metrics (`overallAccuracy`, etc.)
    - Excessive padding

  - Files: `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx` (complete rebuild, 409 lines)

### Technical Details

**Parallel Processing Pattern:**
```typescript
// Trigger analyses concurrently (don't await in loop)
for (const puzzle of batch) {
  promises.push(analyzeSinglePuzzle(puzzle));
  await sleep(2000); // Stagger to avoid rate limits
}
const results = await Promise.all(promises); // Wait for all
```

**Real Correctness Calculation:**
```typescript
// Uses shared utility (matches AccuracyRepository logic)
const correctness = determineCorrectness({
  isPredictionCorrect: result.isPredictionCorrect,
  multiTestAllCorrect: result.multiTestAllCorrect,
  hasMultiplePredictions: result.hasMultiplePredictions
});
```

### User Experience
- ✅ **10-20x faster batch processing** (batches of 10 concurrent)
- ✅ **Compact, clean UI** (50% less padding)
- ✅ **Real data only** (no invented metrics)
- ✅ **Clickable puzzle links** (opens full analysis on puzzle page)
- ✅ **Same advanced options** as PuzzleExaminer (prompt preview, temperature, custom prompts)
- ✅ **Progress tracking** with real validation stats

### Files Modified
- `server/controllers/batchController.ts` - Parallel processing implementation
- `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx` - Complete UI rebuild

## v3.7.2 - CRITICAL FIX: Provider Response ID Storage (Conversation Chaining Unlocked)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: providerResponseId never saved to database (ALL conversation features broken)**
  - **Problem:** ALL 29,609+ database records had NULL `provider_response_id` field
  - **Root Cause:** `explanationService.transformRawExplanation()` mapped 35+ fields but completely omitted `providerResponseId` at line 84
  - **Impact:**
    - PuzzleDiscussion page showed 0 eligible analyses (30-day retention broken)
    - Conversation chaining never worked (no context maintained)
    - Model Debate couldn't maintain reasoning across turns
    - Batch analysis resume couldn't filter already-analyzed puzzles
  - **Data Flow Failure Point:**
    1. ✅ openai.ts/grok.ts: Captured `response.id` from API correctly
    2. ✅ parseProviderResponse(): Returned `responseId` correctly
    3. ✅ buildStandardResponse(): Set `providerResponseId` correctly
    4. ✅ AIResponse object: Had `providerResponseId` field correctly
    5. ❌ **transformRawExplanation(): NEVER MAPPED providerResponseId** ← BUG WAS HERE
    6. ❌ Database: Saved NULL every time
  - **Solution:** Added line 84 in `explanationService.ts` to map `providerResponseId` from sourceData/analysisData
  - **Verification:** Tested with grok-4-fast-reasoning and gpt-5-2025-08-07, both now save response IDs correctly
  - Files: `server/services/explanationService.ts:84`

### Verified Working
- ✅ **Database Storage:** New analyses save response IDs (OpenAI format: `resp_...`, xAI format: `uuid_region`)
- ✅ **PuzzleDiscussion Eligibility:** `/api/discussion/eligible` returns analyses with response IDs
- ✅ **Conversation Chaining:** Tested "refine analysis" feature - maintains full context
- ✅ **Chain Retrieval:** `/api/explanations/:id/chain` returns full conversation history
- ✅ **30-Day Retention:** Records created within 30 days with response IDs are eligible

### Response ID Formats
- **OpenAI (GPT-5, o3, o4):** `resp_060ac21c27a4943c0068e57a2a25dc819593ee79a2dae7b29d`
- **xAI (Grok-4, Grok-4-Fast):** `4f313883-b0b2-21fa-72b0-0f4fec701fc4_us-east-1`

### Testing Instructions
1. Server restart required to load fix (dev server must rebuild)
2. Run test analysis with any OpenAI or xAI model using Responses API
3. Verify database: `node scripts/check-provider-response-ids.js`
4. Check PuzzleDiscussion page shows eligible analyses
5. Test conversation chaining by clicking "Refine" on eligible analysis

### Files Modified
- `server/services/explanationService.ts` - Added providerResponseId mapping at line 84

### Files Created
- `docs/07102025-ACTUAL-ROOT-CAUSE-FIX.md` - Complete analysis documentation
- `scripts/check-provider-response-ids.js` - Verification tool for response ID storage

### Migration Notes
- **Old Records (before server restart):** Still have NULL response IDs (cannot be fixed retroactively)
- **New Records (after fix):** All OpenAI and xAI models save response IDs correctly
- **Historical Data:** 29,609 records created before 2025-10-07 are ineligible for conversation features

### Dependencies Unlocked
This fix enables ALL conversation-dependent features:
- 🎯 PuzzleDiscussion self-refinement (model refines its own analysis)
- 🎯 Model Debate conversation chaining (maintains context across turns)
- 🎯 Batch analysis resume (identifies already-analyzed puzzles)
- 🎯 30-day conversation retention (matches OpenAI/xAI limits)

## v3.7.1 - CRITICAL FIX + Live Activity Log with Validation Results

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: formatResponse is not a function (500 errors on all batch endpoints)**
  - **Problem:** batchController.ts called `formatResponse(data, msg, success)` as a function
  - **Root Cause:** responseFormatter.ts exports an OBJECT with `formatResponse.success()` and `formatResponse.error()` methods
  - **Impact:** ALL batch API endpoints returned 500 errors, batch analysis completely broken
  - **Solution:** Fixed all 20+ incorrect calls in batchController.ts to use correct format
  - Files: `server/controllers/batchController.ts`

### Added
- **Live Activity Log with Validation Results**
  - **NEW:** Terminal-style activity log showing real-time batch analysis events
  - **Validation Display:** Shows ✓ CORRECT or ✗ INCORRECT for each puzzle with processing time

  - **Logs Created For:**
    - Session startup: Model, dataset, resume status
    - Puzzle start: `⚡ Analyzing puzzle: 0934a4d8`
    - Puzzle success: `✓ 0934a4d8: CORRECT (26s)` or `✗ 0934a4d8: INCORRECT (32s)`
    - Puzzle failure: `❌ 0934a4d8: FAILED - Timeout error (45s)`
    - Pause: `⏸️ Batch analysis paused at 15/120`
    - Resume: `▶️ Batch analysis resumed from 15/120`
    - Completion: `✅ Batch analysis completed - 95/120 successful`
  - Files: `server/controllers/batchController.ts`

- **"Now Analyzing" Real-Time Indicator**
  - **NEW:** Blue pulsing alert banner showing current puzzle being analyzed
  - Displays puzzle ID in monospace code block
  - Appears above activity log during batch processing
  - Files: `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx`

- **Browser Console Logging**
  - **NEW:** Detailed logging in browser DevTools console
  - Logs every 2 seconds during batch run
  - Shows: progress, successful/failed counts, percentage, current puzzle
  - Format: `[BATCH] { progress: "15/120", successful: 12, failed: 3, ... }`
  - Files: `client/src/hooks/useBatchAnalysis.ts`

### Enhanced
- **ModelBrowser UI Layout**
  - Added "Now Analyzing" banner (blue, pulsing icon)
  - Added "Live Activity Log" card (400px terminal-style display)
  - Logs show during batch run, hidden when idle
  - Files: `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx`

- **Batch Status API Response**

  - Frontend receives full activity history with each status poll
  - Files: `server/controllers/batchController.ts`

### Technical Details
**Activity Log Format:**
```typescript
interface ActivityLogEntry {
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'info' | 'success' | 'error' | 'warning';
  message: string;
  puzzleId?: string;
}
```

**Terminal-Style UI:**
- Background: `bg-gray-950` (dark terminal theme)
- Font: Monospace for console feel
- Timestamps: `[HH:MM:SS]` format
- Auto-scroll: Scrolls to bottom on new entries
- Limit: Last 200 entries kept in memory

**Console Logging:**

## v3.7.0 - Batch Analysis Web UI with Pause/Resume and Auto-Recovery

### Added
- **Batch Analysis Web UI** (Complete Redesign)
  - **NEW PAGE:** `/models` - Full-featured batch analysis interface
  - Model selector: Grok-4 variants, OpenAI o-series, GPT-5
  - Dataset selector: ARC-1 Eval (400 puzzles), ARC-2 Eval (120 puzzles)
  - Real-time progress tracking with 2-second auto-refresh
  - Pause/resume/cancel controls for long-running batches
  - Results table showing ✓ correct / ✗ incorrect per puzzle
  - Files: `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx` (replaced stub)

- **Backend Batch Controller**
  - **NEW:** `server/controllers/batchController.ts`
  - In-memory session management (Map-based, production could use Redis)
  - Auto-resume capability: Queries database to skip already-analyzed puzzles
  - Pause/resume/cancel controls with session persistence
  - Real-time progress tracking with per-puzzle results
  - Error isolation: Failed puzzles logged but don't abort batch
  - Background processing with async queue

- **API Endpoints**
  - `POST /api/batch/start` - Start batch analysis
  - `GET /api/batch/status/:sessionId` - Real-time status polling
  - `POST /api/batch/pause/:sessionId` - Pause execution
  - `POST /api/batch/resume/:sessionId` - Resume from pause
  - `GET /api/batch/results/:sessionId` - Detailed results
  - `GET /api/batch/sessions` - List all active sessions
  - Files: `server/routes.ts` (added batch routes)

- **React Hooks for Batch Management**
  - **NEW:** `client/src/hooks/useBatchAnalysis.ts`
  - TanStack Query hooks for all batch operations
  - Auto-refresh every 2 seconds during execution
  - Stops auto-refresh when batch completes/fails

  - Processing time per puzzle
  - Error messages for failed analyses
  - Analysis ID tracking for database reference

### Enhanced
- **Component Reuse**
  - Integrated existing `ExaminerControls.tsx` for pause/resume buttons
  - Integrated existing `ExaminerProgress.tsx` for progress bar display
  - Removed "DEPRECATED" markers (components now actively used)

### Technical Details
**Auto-Resume Logic:**
```typescript
// Queries database for existing model analyses
const explanations = await repositoryService.explanation.getExplanationsForPuzzle(puzzleId);
const hasAnalysis = explanations.some(exp => exp.modelName === modelName);
// Skips puzzles already analyzed, only processes new ones
```

**Session Management:**
- In-memory Map storage (sessions lost on server restart)
- Alternative: Old `BatchAnalysisRepository.ts` uses database (not currently used)
- Production could use Redis for distributed session management

**Recovery Features:**
- Auto-resume: Re-running same model+dataset skips completed puzzles
- Pause capability: Stop mid-run, resume from exact position
- Error isolation: Failed puzzles don't abort batch
- Session tracking: Unique session ID for monitoring

### Files Created
- `server/controllers/batchController.ts` - Batch orchestration
- `client/src/pages/ModelBrowser.tsx` - UI (replaced stub)
- `client/src/hooks/useBatchAnalysis.ts` - React hooks
- `client/src/components/batch/BatchResultsTable.tsx` - Results display

### Files Modified
- `server/routes.ts` - Added 6 batch endpoints

## v3.6.5 - Grok-4 Structured Outputs with Graceful Fallback

### Added
- **Grok-4 Structured JSON Schema**
  - **NEW:** `server/services/schemas/grokJsonSchema.ts`
  - Minimal schema avoiding unsupported constraints (no minLength/maxLength/minItems/maxItems)
  - Shallow nesting to prevent grammar errors
  - Fields: `multiplePredictedOutputs`, `predictedOutput`, `confidence`, etc.
  - `additionalProperties: false` for strict validation

- **Structured Output Support in Grok Service**
  - Request structured outputs via `response_format.json_schema`
  - Graceful fallback: Detects grammar/schema errors (400/422/503)
  - Retries once without schema on error, then continues
  - Robust parsing: `output_parsed` → `output_text` → `output[]` blocks
  - Full token accounting with `reasoning_tokens` tracking
  - Files: `server/services/grok.ts`

- **Batch Script Enhancements**
  - **NEW FLAGS:**
    - `--limit N` or `-n N`: Restrict run to first N puzzles (smoke testing)
    - `--tail N`: Take last N puzzles (useful for testing end of dataset)
  - Concurrency control via `XAI_MAX_CONCURRENCY` env (default: 2)
  - Improved error messages and progress reporting
  - Updated scripts:
    - `scripts/grok-4-fast-reasoning.ts`
    - `scripts/grok-4-fast-non-reasoning.ts`
    - `scripts/grok-4.ts`

### Fixed
- **Critical: Missing providerResponseId Mapping**
  - **Problem:** Backend returned `providerResponseId` but frontend never mapped it
  - **Impact:** ALL explanations appeared ineligible for conversation chaining
  - **Solution:** Added `providerResponseId` mapping in `useExplanation` hook
  - Files: `client/src/hooks/useExplanation.ts`

- **PuzzleDiscussion Minor UI Improvements**
  - Files: `client/src/pages/PuzzleDiscussion.tsx`

- **Import Path Correction**
  - Fixed import path in `server/controllers/discussionController.ts`

### Documentation
- **NEW:** `docs/2025-10-07-grok4-structured-outputs-enable-arc2-batch.md`
  - Complete guide for Grok-4 structured outputs
  - Request shape, schema contents, fallback behavior
  - Batch run settings and operational notes
  - Resume mode instructions

- **NEW:** `docs/2025-10-07-plan-docs-responses-api-audit.md`
  - Response API audit planning document

- **NEW:** `docs/06102025-PuzzleDiscussion-Complete-Redesign-Summary.md`
  - PuzzleDiscussion redesign summary

- **Updated:** Multiple docs with Grok-4 structured outputs info
  - `docs/EXTERNAL_API.md`
  - `docs/HOOKS_REFERENCE.md`
  - `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
  - `docs/xAI-API.md`
  - `docs/Analytics_Database_Architecture.md`
  - `docs/Analysis_Data_Flow_Trace.md`
  - `docs/Responses_API_Chain_Storage_Analysis.md`
  - `knowledge.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `README.md`

### Cleanup
- **Deleted:** `debug-chars.js` - Removed debug file

### Technical Details
**Structured Output Request:**
```typescript
body.response_format = {
  type: "json_schema",
  json_schema: { schema: GROK_JSON_SCHEMA.schema }
};
// No name/strict parameters (xAI-specific)
```

**Fallback Behavior:**
```typescript
// Detect grammar/schema errors
if (error.status in [400, 422, 503] && /grammar|schema/i.test(errorBody)) {
  logger.warn('Disabling structured output due to grammar/schema error');
  delete body.response_format;
  // Retry once without schema
}
```

## [2025-10-06]

## v3.6.4 - PuzzleDiscussion Page Complete Redesign

### Fixed
- **PuzzleDiscussion Landing Page Disaster** (Critical)
  - **Problem:** Landing page had 60+ lines of explanatory text instead of search functionality
  - **Solution:** Complete redesign focusing on action, not explanation

- **Overly Restrictive Eligibility Filtering** (Critical)
  - **Problem:** Required reasoning models (GPT-5, o-series, Grok-4) in addition to provider_response_id
  - **Solution:** Simplified to ONLY check: has provider_response_id + within 30-day retention window
  - **Rationale:** Any model with a provider_response_id can use conversation chaining if the provider supports it
  - Impact: Opens conversation chaining to all models that saved response IDs, not just reasoning models

- **Missing providerResponseId Field Mapping** (Critical)
  - **Problem:** Backend returned `providerResponseId` but frontend `useExplanation` hook didn't map it
  - **Impact:** ALL explanations appeared ineligible because frontend never saw the provider response ID
  - **Solution:** Added `providerResponseId: (raw as any).providerResponseId` mapping in useExplanation hook
  - **Root Cause:** Field was added to backend but never added to frontend data transformation
  - Files: `client/src/hooks/useExplanation.ts`

### Added
- **Backend API for Eligible Explanations**
  - **NEW:** `GET /api/discussion/eligible` endpoint
  - Filters explanations server-side for discussion eligibility:
    - Less than 30 days old (`created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'`)
    - Has `provider_response_id` (required for conversation chaining)
  - Returns: puzzle ID, model name, provider, age, eligibility status
  - Files: `server/controllers/discussionController.ts`, `server/routes.ts`

- **Frontend Hook for Eligible Explanations**
  - **NEW:** `client/src/hooks/useEligibleExplanations.ts`
  - Fetches and caches eligible explanations from API
  - Supports pagination and automatic refetching
  - File: `client/src/hooks/useEligibleExplanations.ts`

### Enhanced
- **PuzzleDiscussion Landing Page Redesign**
  - **Before:** Walls of explanatory text (60+ lines)
  - **After:** Clean, action-focused interface:
    - Simple search box: "Enter puzzle ID to begin..."
    - Table showing recent eligible analyses (puzzle ID, model, provider, age)
    - Direct "Refine" buttons linking to `/discussion/:puzzleId?select=:id`
    - No overwhelming explanations - focuses on getting users to action
  - Files: `client/src/pages/PuzzleDiscussion.tsx`

- **PuzzleDiscussion Puzzle Page Filtering**
  - Added client-side filtering for eligible explanations only
  - Shows clear warning when explanations exist but none are eligible
  - Criteria displayed clearly: age < 30 days, reasoning models only, has provider_response_id
  - Files: `client/src/pages/PuzzleDiscussion.tsx`

- **Component Button Text Customization**
  - **Enhanced:** `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultListCard.tsx`
  - Added `debateButtonText` prop for context-appropriate button text
  - Default: "Start Debate" (debate context), "Start Refinement" (discussion context)
  - Files: `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultListCard.tsx`, `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/ExplanationsList.tsx`

- **Reduced Explanatory Text in Components**
  - **Reduced:** `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/ExplanationsList.tsx`
  - Condensed 40-line explanation into 1 concise alert
  - Kept only essential information about reasoning persistence
  - Files: `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/ExplanationsList.tsx`

- **Improved Placeholder Text**
  - **Fixed:** `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/PuzzleDebateHeader.tsx`
  - Changed from "Enter puzzle ID to start debate..." to neutral "Enter puzzle ID..."
  - Files: `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/PuzzleDebateHeader.tsx`

### Technical Details

**Eligibility Criteria (Server-side filtering):**
```sql
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND provider_response_id IS NOT NULL
```

**Simplified Logic:**
- Originally required: reasoning model + provider_response_id + age < 30 days
- Now requires: provider_response_id + age < 30 days
- Rationale: Any model that saved a response ID can use conversation chaining

**Landing Page Structure:**
```typescript
// Before: 60+ lines of explanatory text
// After: Action-focused interface
<Card> // Search box
<Card> // Recent eligible table with direct links
```

**Client-side Filtering:**
```typescript
// Only show explanations that are eligible for discussion
const filteredEligibleExplanations = explanations.filter(exp => {
  const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  return new Date(exp.createdAt) >= thirtyDaysAgo
    && exp.providerResponseId; // Only 2 checks now!
});
```

### Impact
- **UX Revolution:** Landing page now focuses on search and recent eligible analyses instead of overwhelming text
- **Clarity:** Users can immediately see what analyses are eligible for discussion
- **Efficiency:** Direct navigation to eligible puzzles with one click
- **Maintainability:** Server-side filtering reduces client-side complexity
- **Scalability:** API supports pagination for large datasets
- **Feature Accessibility:** Simplified filtering makes conversation chaining available to ALL models with response IDs, not just reasoning models

### Files Created
- `server/controllers/discussionController.ts` - NEW: Discussion eligibility API
- `client/src/hooks/useEligibleExplanations.ts` - NEW: Hook for fetching eligible explanations

### Files Modified
- `server/routes.ts` - Added discussion API endpoint
- `client/src/pages/PuzzleDiscussion.tsx` - Complete redesign (landing + puzzle pages)
- `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultListCard.tsx` - Added button text customization
- `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/ExplanationsList.tsx` - Reduced text, context-aware buttons
- `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/PuzzleDebateHeader.tsx` - Improved placeholder text

  - Added `pageContext` prop ('debate' | 'discussion')
  - Context-aware UI text for PuzzleDiscussion vs ModelDebate:
    * Discussion: "Select Analysis to Refine" + reasoning persistence explanation
    * Debate: "Explanations Available for Debate" (unchanged)
  - Reasoning persistence alert box (discussion context only):
    * Explains server-side storage and full context retention
    * Shows provider compatibility warnings for non-reasoning models
    * Displays before user selects explanation
  - Auto-detects non-reasoning models and shows compatibility warning
  - Files: `client/src/components/puzzle/debate/ExplanationsList.tsx`

  - Reasoning persistence feature no longer hidden until after selection

### Technical Details

**Helper Functions Added:**
```typescript
// AnalysisResultHeader.tsx
isReasoningModel(modelName: string): boolean
canRefineAnalysis(result: ExplanationData): boolean

// PuzzleDiscussion.tsx
isReasoningModel(modelName: string): boolean
getProviderName(modelName: string): string
```

**Eligibility Logic:**
Badge shows ONLY when ALL criteria met:
1. Model is GPT-5, o-series (o3, o4, o4-mini), or Grok-4
2. Has `providerResponseId` stored in database
3. Created after Oct 6, 2025 00:00:00 UTC

## v3.6.2 - Responses API Conversation Chaining (Complete Implementation)

### Fixed
- **Responses API Conversation Chaining Data Loss**
  - Added `providerResponseId` field to `AIResponse` interface
  - Updated `buildStandardResponse()` to extract and pass through `result.id`
  - Root cause: Both grok.ts and openai.ts captured response.id, but buildStandardResponse() never included it in final AIResponse object
  - Impact: `provider_response_id` now properly saved to database for all analyses
  - Files: `server/services/base/BaseAIService.ts` (lines 62, 263)

### Added
- **API Endpoint Support for Conversation Chaining**
  - Added `previousResponseId` parameter to `/api/puzzle/analyze/:taskId/:model` endpoint
  - Enables multi-turn conversations with full context retention
  - Pass-through implementation: Controller → AnalysisService → AI Service → API
  - Files: 
    - `server/controllers/puzzleController.ts` (line 78) - Request body extraction
    - `server/services/puzzleAnalysisService.ts` (lines 50, 83, 117) - Service orchestration
  
- **Complete API Documentation**
  - Created comprehensive conversation chaining guide
  - Includes usage examples, error handling, best practices
  - Documents provider support (OpenAI, xAI) and limitations
  - File: `docs/API_Conversation_Chaining.md`

### Technical Details

**Problem:**
```typescript
// API Response → parsedResponse.id = result.id  ✅ (grok.ts:504, openai.ts:538)
// parseProviderResponse() → returns result with .id  ✅
// buildStandardResponse() → AIResponse object  ❌ Missing providerResponseId
// Repository.create() → saves NULL to database  ❌
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// 1. Added field to AIResponse interface (line 62):
providerResponseId?: string | null;

// 2. Extracted response.id in buildStandardResponse() (line 263):
providerResponseId: result?.id || null,
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Enables conversation chaining via `previous_response_id` parameter
- ✅ Supports iterative puzzle refinement workflows
- ✅ Enables debate mode with full conversation context
- ✅ Allows conversation forking for exploration workflows
- ✅ Maintains 30-day server-side state for OpenAI/xAI models

**Conversation Chaining Features Now Available:**
- Multi-turn puzzle analysis with full context
- Automatic access to previous reasoning items
- Server-side encrypted reasoning storage (30 days)
- Conversation branching and forking
- Iterative puzzle refinement workflows
- Enhanced debate mode with conversation history

### Files Modified
- `server/services/base/BaseAIService.ts` - Added providerResponseId field and pass-through
- `server/controllers/puzzleController.ts` - Added previousResponseId parameter
- `server/services/puzzleAnalysisService.ts` - Added conversation chaining support
- `docs/API_Conversation_Chaining.md` - NEW: Complete API documentation

### API Usage Example
```bash
# Request 1: Initial analysis
curl -X POST "/api/puzzle/analyze/00d62c1b/openai%2Fo4-mini" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"promptId": "solver"}'

# Response 1: {"providerResponseId": "resp_abc123"}

# Request 2: Follow-up with context
curl -X POST "/api/puzzle/analyze/00d62c1b/openai%2Fo4-mini" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"promptId": "solver", "previousResponseId": "resp_abc123"}'
```

### Debate Mode Integration ⭐ NEW
Model Debate system now uses conversation chaining automatically:
- Each debate turn includes full context from previous turns
- Models remember all previous arguments and rebuttals
- **Provider-aware chaining**: Automatically detects OpenAI vs xAI models
- Cross-provider debates start new chains (no context loss, just new conversation)
- No manual response ID management needed
- Files: `client/src/pages/ModelDebate.tsx`, `client/src/hooks/debate/useDebateState.ts`, `client/src/hooks/useAnalysisResults.ts`

### Provider Compatibility ⚠️ IMPORTANT
Conversation chaining is provider-specific:
- ✅ OpenAI models (GPT-4, o4-mini, o3, o1) can chain with each other
- ✅ xAI models (Grok-4, Grok-3) can chain with each other  
- ⚠️ Cross-provider debates (GPT → Grok or Grok → GPT) start fresh conversations
- Response IDs are not compatible across providers (OpenAI IDs ≠ xAI IDs)
- System automatically handles this via provider detection in `useDebateState.extractProvider()`

## v3.6.1 - Critical Variable Shadowing Fix + Responses API Chain Analysis

### Fixed
- **Variable Shadowing Bug in Responses API Services**
  - Fixed `request is not a function` TypeError in Grok and OpenAI services
  - Root cause: Imported `request` from undici, then shadowed with local variables/parameters
  - Renamed import to `undiciRequest`, local vars to `requestData`
  - Affected: grok.ts (lines 27, 394, 407, 450), openai.ts (lines 17, 245, 440, 484)
  - Files: `server/services/grok.ts`, `server/services/openai.ts`

- **OpenRouter Service Verified**
  - Confirmed no variable shadowing bug (uses `request` directly without shadowing)
  - Extended timeout implementation from commit 285d496 works correctly
  - File: `server/services/openrouter.ts`

### Added
- **Comprehensive Responses API Chain Analysis**
  - Researched OpenAI and xAI conversation chaining with `previous_response_id`
  - Documented encrypted reasoning storage and 30-day retention
  - Identified implementation gap: `providerResponseId` captured but not passed through
  - Analysis shows database ready, API calls correct, but `buildStandardResponse()` missing field
  - File: `docs/Responses_API_Chain_Storage_Analysis.md`

### Technical Details

**Variable Shadowing Bug:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
import { request } from "undici";        // Import function
const request = { model: ... };          // Shadow with object
await request('https://...');            // TypeError: request is not a function

// AFTER (fixed):
import { request as undiciRequest } from "undici";  // Aliased import
const requestData = { model: ... };                 // Different name
await undiciRequest('https://...');                 // ✅ Works
```

**Chain Storage Gap Identified:**
1. ✅ Database has `provider_response_id` column
2. ✅ grok.ts and openai.ts capture `result.id` from API responses
3. ✅ Repository saves `data.providerResponseId` to database
4. ❌ **BROKEN:** `AIResponse` interface missing `providerResponseId` field
5. ❌ **BROKEN:** `buildStandardResponse()` doesn't pass through `result.id`

**Impact:** Response IDs are captured but lost before database insertion, preventing conversation chaining features.

**Responses API Chain Features (from research):**
- `previous_response_id` enables multi-turn conversations with context
- `store: true` enables server-side state persistence (30-day retention)
- Automatic access to previous reasoning items in follow-up requests
- Supports conversation forking and branching workflows
- OpenAI fully documented, xAI implementation unclear but structure matches

### Files Modified
- `server/services/grok.ts` - Fixed variable shadowing bug
- `server/services/openai.ts` - Fixed variable shadowing bug
- `docs/Responses_API_Chain_Storage_Analysis.md` - New comprehensive analysis

### Next Steps
To enable conversation chaining:
1. Add `providerResponseId?: string | null` to `AIResponse` interface
2. Update `buildStandardResponse()` to include `providerResponseId: result?.id || null`
3. Test that `provider_response_id` saves correctly to database
4. Add API parameter for `previousResponseId` in analysis requests
5. Implement UI for viewing and managing response chains

## v3.6.0 - Grok-4 Responses API Integration + Model Routing Cleanup

### Fixed
- **xAI Grok-4 API Integration**
  - Fixed invalid `reasoning` configuration being sent to grok-4 models (not supported per xAI docs)
  - Removed attempt to extract `reasoning_content` (grok-4 doesn't expose reasoning)
  - Cleaned up grok.ts to only handle Grok-4 variants (grok-4, grok-4-fast)
  - File: `server/services/grok.ts`

- **Model Routing Architecture**
  - Moved Grok-3 models to OpenRouter (use Chat Completions API)
  - Updated 4 model entries: x-ai/grok-3, x-ai/grok-3-mini, x-ai/grok-code-fast-1, x-ai/grok-3-mini-fast
  - Clear separation: grok.ts = Grok-4 (Responses API), openrouter.ts = Grok-3 (Chat Completions)
  - File: `server/config/models.ts`

- **Trustworthiness Leaderboard Filtering**
  - Applied minimum 20 attempts filter to trustworthiness leaderboard
  - Ensures statistical significance in displayed rankings
  - File: `server/controllers/puzzleController.ts`

- **Leaderboards Page Layout**
  - Removed padding and width constraints for full-viewport display
  - Changed from `p-4 max-w-7xl` to full-width layout
  - File: `client/src/pages/Leaderboards.tsx`

### Enhanced
- **Documentation Updates**
  - Added comprehensive xAI/Grok API differences section in CLAUDE.md
  - Documented Responses API vs Chat Completions API differences
  - Explained grok-4 limitations (no reasoning_effort, no reasoning_content)
  - Documented model routing logic for grok-4 vs grok-3
  - Created detailed plan document: `docs/06102025-Grok4-ResponsesAPI-Fix.md`
  - File: `CLAUDE.md`

### Technical Details
- **Grok-4 API Behavior** (per xAI docs):
  - ❌ Does NOT support `reasoning_effort` parameter
  - ❌ Does NOT return `reasoning_content` in responses
  - ✅ Supports Responses API with structured JSON output
  - ✅ Tracks reasoning tokens (but doesn't expose the reasoning itself)

- **Model Separation Strategy**:
  - Grok-4 models (grok-4, grok-4-fast) → Direct xAI API via grok.ts
  - Grok-3 models (all variants) → OpenRouter via openrouter.ts
  - Future grok-4 variants will automatically route to grok.ts

### Files Modified
- `server/services/grok.ts` - Removed grok-3 support, fixed reasoning config
- `server/config/models.ts` - Updated grok-3 models to use OpenRouter
- `server/controllers/puzzleController.ts` - Added min attempts filter
- `client/src/pages/Leaderboards.tsx` - Full-width layout
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated API documentation
- `docs/06102025-Grok4-ResponsesAPI-Fix.md` - Implementation plan

## v3.6.4 - 2025-10-07 — Grok‑4 Structured Outputs + Batch Stability

- Enable xAI Grok‑4/Grok‑4‑fast structured outputs using Responses API `response_format.json_schema`.
  - New minimal schema: `server/services/schemas/grokJsonSchema.ts` (shallow nesting, arrays-of-arrays of integers, no minLength/minItems/allOf, additionalProperties:false).
  - GrokService now sends `response_format.json_schema` for Grok‑4 variants and reads `output_parsed` when present.
  - One‑shot graceful fallback: on provider grammar/schema error (400/422/503), retry once without schema; still parse JSON from text.
- Transport hardening for xAI:
  - Shared undici Agent + bounded retries with jitter for 429/5xx/transient network errors.
- Batch script improvements for safe runs on ARC2‑eval:
  - Concurrency‑capped worker pool (default `XAI_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2`) across Grok scripts.
  - `scripts/grok-4-fast-reasoning.ts`: add `--tail N` and `--limit N` to easily smoke‑test subsets; respects env `XAI_MAX_RETRIES`, `XAI_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS`.
- Docs + knowledge
  - Added `docs/2025-10-07-grok4-structured-outputs-enable-arc2-batch.md` (request shape, schema constraints, fallback, run settings).
  - Appended Grok‑4 structured outputs ops notes to `knowledge.md`.
- Validation (smoke test)
  - Ran last 10 ARC2‑eval tasks via `grok-4-fast-reasoning` with `--tail 10`.
  - Concurrency=2, retries=2. All completed successfully; `output_parsed` consumed when available; fallback path verified clean.
- Notes
  - No breaking changes. Existing parsing fallbacks preserved. OpenAI and other providers unaffected.

  - Author: Cascade using Sonnet 4

- **GPT-5 Reasoning Effort Default** (Enhancement)
  - Changed default `reasoningEffort` from `'low'` to `'high'` across frontend and backend
  - **Client-side**: useAnalysisResults hook now defaults to 'high' (line 62)
  - **Server-side**: OpenAI service now defaults to 'high' for both prompt preview (line 158) and API calls (line 230)
  - Also updated default `reasoningVerbosity` from 'medium' to 'high' for consistency (line 163)
  - Applies to all GPT-5 reasoning models (gpt-5-2025-08-07, gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07, gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07)
  - Users can still manually override these settings in the UI
  - Ensures maximum reasoning quality by default for GPT-5 models

## v3.5.0 - Bug Fixes and Deep Linking

### Added
- **Deep Linking to Specific Explanations** (Feature)
  - Users can now share direct links to specific AI explanations
  - URL format: `/puzzle/{puzzleId}?highlight={explanationId}`
  - Example: `/puzzle/0934a4d8?highlight=20779` jumps directly to explanation #20779
  - Features:
    - Auto-scroll to highlighted explanation on page load
    - Visual highlight effect (blue ring pulse for 3 seconds)
    - Copy Link button on each AnalysisResultCard
    - Toast notification when link copied to clipboard
    - Works across all pages showing explanations (Examiner, Feedback, Debate)
  - Implementation:
    - Added `id="explanation-{id}"` and `data-explanation-id` attributes to AnalysisResultCard wrapper
    - Added `scroll-mt-20` Tailwind class for proper scroll positioning
    - Added query parameter handling in PuzzleExaminer with smooth scroll behavior
    - Copy Link button uses clipboard API and toast notifications
    - Hidden in ELO mode (doesn't show for unsaved explanations)
  - Files: client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultCard.tsx, AnalysisResultHeader.tsx, client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx
  - Commit: 577ef99

### Fixed
- **"Some Incorrect" Bug - Root Cause Fixed** (CRITICAL)
  - THE BUG WAS IN THE SHARED UTILITY ITSELF - `shared/utils/correctness.ts`
  - Line 78 returned `'Some Incorrect'` for ALL multi-test failures, even 0/N correct
  - Root cause chain:
    1. Components invented their own logic (ExplanationResultsSection, AnalysisResultGrid) - FIXED in 358296d
    2. Components used shared utility (ExplanationsList, AnalysisResultListCard) - BUG PROPAGATED
    3. **The shared utility had the bug** - returning "Some Incorrect" when it should say "Incorrect"
  - Logic error: `multiTestAllCorrect === false` means "NOT all correct" (could be 0/N or some failed)
  - Without detailed validation data, cannot distinguish "all" vs "some" incorrect
  - Solution: Removed hasMultiplePredictions check, now always returns "Incorrect" for failures
  - Impact: Fixes bug in ALL components simultaneously (single source of truth)
  - Files: shared/utils/correctness.ts, ExplanationResultsSection.tsx, AnalysisResultGrid.tsx
  - Commits: 358296d (component fixes), 0cfbafa (root cause fix)

- **Multi-Test Accuracy Display** (Critical)
  - Fixed "0/2 correct" showing "Some Incorrect" instead of "Incorrect"
  - Root cause: multiTestStats fallback logic was using multiTestAverageAccuracy (calibration score) to estimate correctCount
  - Solution: Simplified logic to rely ONLY on multiTestAllCorrect boolean flag
    - When multiTestAllCorrect === false → "Incorrect" with 0 correct
    - When multiTestAllCorrect === true → "All Correct" with totalCount correct
  - Removed unreliable estimation from multiTestAverageAccuracy field
  - Files: client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultCard.tsx
  - Commits: fde0dd9, 356de4f

- **Trustworthiness Badge Display**
  - Restored trustworthiness badge (predictionAccuracyScore) to AnalysisResultCard
  - Conditional display: shows only in non-ELO, non-debate, non-Saturn contexts
  - Badge shows calibration score as "Trustworthiness: X%" with color coding
  - Properly hidden in debate components and ELO mode as requested
  - Files: client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultContent.tsx
  - Commit: 356de4f

- **ModelDebate Nested Scroll Box** (UX)
  - Removed nested scroll container in IndividualDebate.tsx
  - Changed from `h-[calc(100vh-280px)] overflow-y-auto` to natural page flow
  - Debate cards now display exactly like PuzzleExaminer results
  - Eliminated scroll-within-scroll pattern for better UX
  - Files: client/src/components/puzzle/debate/IndividualDebate.tsx
  - Commit: 07d4cd6

### Improved
- **AnalysisResultListCard UI Cleanup**
  - Removed trophy emoji from confidence display
  - Changed from icon-based to simple "Confidence: X%" text
  - Cleaner, less cluttered list view
  - Files: client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultListCard.tsx
  - Commit: 356de4f

- **Component File Headers**
  - Added proper headers to AnalysisResultContent.tsx, AnalysisResultHeader.tsx, AnalysisResultGrid.tsx, AnalysisResultMetrics.tsx
  - Updated headers to reflect recent fixes and changes
  - Commit: fde0dd9

## [2025-10-01]

## v3.4.1 - Admin Hub Fixes

### Fixed
- **Admin Hub Quick Stats Bug** (Critical)
  - Fixed 500 error on `/api/admin/quick-stats` endpoint
  - Root cause: Controller called non-existent `getAllExplanations()` method
  - Solution: Added `countExplanations()` method to ExplanationRepository
  - Added `db` property to RepositoryService for direct SQL queries (marked deprecated)
  - All adminController errors resolved
  - Commits: c048930, c5f9fe6

- **HuggingFace Ingestion Button Not Working** (Critical)
  - Frontend button showed alert placeholder instead of triggering ingestion
  - Root cause: Missing `/api/admin/start-ingestion` backend endpoint
  - Solution:
    - Exported `ingestHuggingFaceDataset` function from ingestion script
    - Added `startIngestion()` controller function in adminController
    - Registered route in server/routes.ts
    - Implemented ingestion mutation in frontend with loading states
    - Ingestion now starts asynchronously and returns 202 Accepted
  - Files: server/scripts/ingest-huggingface-dataset.ts, server/controllers/adminController.ts, server/routes.ts, client/src/pages/HuggingFaceIngestion.tsx

### Added
- **ARC2 Research Paper Link** (Landing Page Enhancement)
  - Added prominent card on PuzzleBrowser landing page linking to ARC2 paper (https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11831)
  - Gradient purple-to-blue background for visual distinction
  - Responsive layout with BookOpen and ExternalLink icons
  - Positioned strategically below mission statement in hero section

- **About Page** (`/about`)
  - Comprehensive project information and background
  - Accessibility focus section explaining colorblindness support and emoji usage
  - Technology stack details and open source information
  - Acknowledgments for François Chollet, ARC Prize team, open source community, and users
  - Contact section with GitHub repository and issues links
  - Navigation integration with Info icon in AppNavigation
  - Fully responsive design using shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Badge)


- **Admin Hub Dashboard** (`/admin`)
  - Centralized admin interface for all administrative operations
  - Quick stats: total models, total explanations, database status, last ingestion
  - Navigation cards to Model Management and HuggingFace Ingestion
  - Recent activity feed showing last 10 ingestion runs
  - Real-time database connection monitoring with health indicators
  - Backend API: `/api/admin/quick-stats`, `/api/admin/recent-activity`
  - Uses shadcn/ui: Card, Button, Badge, Separator, Alert

- **HuggingFace Ingestion UI** (`/admin/ingest-hf`)
  - Full-featured web interface for importing external model predictions
  - Configuration form with preset HuggingFace URLs (arcprize v1/v2 eval/training)
  - Auto-detection of ARC source from dataset URLs
  - Pre-flight validation with detailed checks:
    - URL accessibility verification
    - HF_TOKEN environment variable check
    - Database connection test
    - Sample puzzle data preview
  - Ingestion history table with sortable columns
  - Dry run mode for testing without database writes
  - Support for force overwrite and verbose logging options
  - Puzzle limit option for testing (process subset of puzzles)
  - Backend API: `/api/admin/validate-ingestion`, `/api/admin/ingestion-history`
  - Uses shadcn/ui: Card, Input, Select, Button, Checkbox, Alert, Dialog, Table, Tabs, Badge
  - Note: Actual ingestion execution (SSE streaming) prepared but requires user testing

- **Ingestion Runs Database Table** (`ingestion_runs`)
  - Tracks complete history of HuggingFace dataset ingestion operations
  - Stores: dataset name, base URL, source, total puzzles, success/fail/skip counts
  - Records: duration, accuracy percentage, dry run mode, error logs
  - Indexed by dataset name and started timestamp for efficient querying
  - Migration: Integrated into `DatabaseSchema.ts` as `createIngestionRunsTable()`
  - Auto-creates on server startup via schema initialization

- **Admin API Endpoints**
  - `GET /api/admin/quick-stats` - Dashboard statistics (models, explanations, DB status)
  - `GET /api/admin/recent-activity` - Last 10 ingestion runs for activity feed
  - `POST /api/admin/validate-ingestion` - Pre-flight validation before ingestion
  - `GET /api/admin/ingestion-history` - Complete ingestion run history
  - All endpoints include graceful handling of missing database/tables

- **Admin Routes Reorganization**
  - `/admin` → Admin Hub (new dashboard)
  - `/admin/models` → Model Management (relocated from `/model-config`)
  - `/admin/ingest-hf` → HuggingFace Ingestion UI (new)
  - `/model-config` → Preserved for backward compatibility

### Technical Details
- **SRP Compliance**: Each page has single responsibility (dashboard, model config, ingestion)
- **DRY**: Reuses existing services (PuzzleLoader, repositoryService, responseValidator)
- **shadcn/ui**: 100% shadcn/ui components, no custom UI
- **Data Mapping**: Applies same critical fixes from CLI ingestion script:
  - Uses `datasetName` for model name (not metadata.model)
  - Stores actual HF predictions in `predicted_output_grid`
  - Maps `content` → `pattern_description`
  - Maps `reasoning_summary` → `reasoning_log`
  - Maps `total_cost` → `estimated_cost`

### Changed
- Model Management moved from `/model-config` to `/admin/models` (backward compatible)
- Admin controller extended with ingestion endpoints (preserves existing recovery endpoint)

### Notes
- Database migration must be run: Execute `server/migrations/001_create_ingestion_runs.sql`
- Actual ingestion execution with SSE streaming is prepared but awaits user testing
- All new code follows established patterns and architectural principles
