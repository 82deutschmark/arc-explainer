# AI-Built ARC Explainer Platform Highlights

- **Full-stack ARC research lab, built by AI orchestration.** End-to-end production system spanning `client/` (React + shadcn/ui), `shared/` schemas, and `server/` (Express + Drizzle + Railway/Postgres). All authored through pair-programming with AI agents—no traditional dev team required.
- **Battle-tested multi-provider engine.** Unified `BaseAIService` pipeline coordinates GPT‑5, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4, DeepSeek, OpenRouter partners, and the custom Saturn visual solver. Standardized validation (`responseValidator.ts`) keeps confidence, accuracy, and prediction grids aligned across 20+ models.
- **Real-time analysis UX that feels instant.** Optimistic updates in `PuzzleExaminer` show ANALYZING→SAVING→COMPLETED progress, shadcn/ui badges, and actionable errors the moment runs start—no more waiting 30 seconds for feedback.
- **Reasoning capture you can audit.** OpenAI Responses API, GPT‑5 reasoning parameters, and structured logging preserve `reasoning_log`, `reasoning_items`, and full `provider_raw_response`. Every expensive API call is stored before parsing, enabling post-mortem analysis without data loss.
- **Multi-test integrity restored and defended.** Critical fixes in `responseValidator.ts`, `BaseAIService.ts`, and `ExplanationRepository.ts` ensure `multiple_predicted_outputs`, `multi_test_results`, and grid arrays survive validation. Visual dashboards now trust the database again.
- **Cost architecture with dedicated ownership.** `CostRepository.ts` centralizes token + dollar tracking, removing SRP violations from analytics repositories. All dashboards consume harmonized numbers, eliminating conflicting cost stories.
- **Analytics that spotlight real failures.** Overhauled `PuzzleOverview`, leaderboards, and Model Comparison Matrix showcase overconfidence flags, processing-time waste, and true top performers—supported by docs like `24Sept-AnalyticsOverhaul-ModelFailureAnalysis.md`.
- **Automation that scales hobby tooling.** AI-authored scripts (`npm run ap`, `au`, `retry`, `recover`) manage batch testing, dataset sync, backfills, and recovery flows with CLI + REST triggers. Solo dev keeps pace with enterprise workflows.
- **Saturn Visual Solver with live UI bridge.** Python `solver/arc_visual_solver.py` streams multimodal reasoning back to React via `saturnVisualService.ts` and WebSockets, logging `saturn_events`, `saturn_log`, and inference imagery straight into the explanations table.
- **Resilient logging and sanitization everywhere.** Central logger trims 10k-character dumps, JSON parsers auto-harden against markdown responses, and grid sanitizers guarantee numeric-only storage—even when models hallucinate characters.
- **End-user ready distribution.** Railway deployment, Docker builds, and unrestricted analytics APIs (`EXTERNAL_API.md`) make it easy for educators, researchers, and hobbyists to tap into the platform with minimal setup.
