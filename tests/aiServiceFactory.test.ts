 * PURPOSE: Ensures aiServiceFactory canonicalizes OpenAI-prefixed model keys and
 *          routes them to the OpenAI provider while leaving other models intact.
 *          Guards against regressions when new providers are added to the routing table.
 * SRP/DRY check: Pass â€” isolates canonicalization behaviour without duplicating provider tests.
