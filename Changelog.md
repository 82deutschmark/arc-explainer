## Version 1.7.3 ‚Äî Database Service Refactor Complete (2025-08-23)

### üöÄ Major Architectural Improvement (Code by Cascade)
- **Database Service Refactor**: Finalized the transition to a strict, layered architecture by removing the legacy database compatibility layer from `server/db/index.ts`.
- **Consistent Service Layer Usage**: Refactored all controllers and services (`puzzleController`, `feedbackService`, `puzzleService`) to exclusively use the new repository-based data access patterns, improving code consistency and maintainability.
- **Lint Error Resolution**: Fixed all TypeScript linting errors that arose from the architectural changes, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

### üêõ Bug Fixes (Code by Cascade)
- **Corrected Data Access Logic**: Fixed data access logic in `puzzleService` and `feedbackService` to correctly handle data shapes returned by the new repository layer (e.g., `snake_case` vs. `camelCase` properties, `Array` vs. `Map` return types).
- **Restored Frontend Functionality**: The refactoring and bug fixes have restored full functionality to the puzzle overview and feedback systems, which were previously broken due to the inconsistent data access patterns.

## Version 1.7.2 ‚Äî Logger Signature Fix (2025-08-23)

### üêõ Bug Fixes (Code by Cascade)
- **Corrected Logger Calls**: Fixed all logger calls in `server/db/repositories/explanations.ts` to align with the correct `(message: string, context: string)` signature.
- **Fixed Zod Validation Error**: Added a null check for `api_processing_time_ms` in `getWithFeedbackCounts` to prevent parsing errors when the database value is null.
  - **Root Cause**: Previous implementations passed an object for context, which is not supported by the current logger utility, causing runtime errors and malformed logs.
  - **Solution**: Refactored all logger calls to embed contextual data as a JSON string within the primary message. This ensures type safety and correct log output.
  - **Impact**: All database repository logs are now correctly formatted and no longer cause TypeScript errors.

### üö® Critical Bug Fixes (Code by Claude Code)
- **DeepSeek & Grok System Prompt Integration**: Fixed critical issue where DeepSeek and Grok services were ignoring system prompts after the system prompt architecture implementation
  - **Root Cause**: Both services were only using `promptPackage.userPrompt` but ignoring `promptPackage.systemPrompt` where JSON schema instructions had moved
  - **Solution**: Updated both services to properly extract and use both system and user prompts in API calls
  - **System Prompt Mode Support**: Added `systemPromptMode` parameter supporting both 'ARC' (structured prompts) and 'None' (legacy) modes
  - **Message Structure Fix**: Both services now create proper message arrays with system role when in ARC mode
  - **Preview Generation Fix**: Updated `generatePromptPreview()` methods to show correct system/user prompt structure
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `server/services/deepseek.ts` - Added system prompt integration and ARC mode support
    - `server/services/grok.ts` - Added system prompt integration and ARC mode support
  - **Impact**: DeepSeek and Grok services now properly receive JSON schema instructions, fixing response format issues
- **System Prompt Support (Code by Claude Code)**: Comprehensive implementation of JSON-structure-enforcing system prompts across all AI providers
  - **{ARC} Mode (Default)**: Structured system prompts enforce exact JSON format with answer-first output (`predictedOutput`/`predictedOutputs` always first)
  - **{None} Mode**: Legacy behavior for backward compatibility (all instructions mixed in user message)
  - **Smart Selection**: Automatically chooses appropriate system prompt based on solver mode, multi-test scenarios, and alien communication templates
  - **Provider-Specific Implementation**: 
    - OpenAI: Uses system message in input array
    - Anthropic: Uses dedicated `system` parameter  
    - Gemini: Uses `systemInstruction` with parts array
    - Grok/DeepSeek: Uses standard system message role
  - **Frontend UI**: Added intuitive system prompt mode selection in Advanced Options with clear {ARC}/{None} toggle

### üéØ Benefits

## Version 1.4.6 ‚Äî Markdown JSON Response Parsing Fix (2025-08-21)

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **OpenAI Markdown JSON Parsing (Code by Claude Code)**: Fixed specific OpenAI models wrapping JSON responses in markdown code blocks
  - **Affected Models**: `gpt-5-chat-latest` and `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` were returning responses as ````json {"patternDescription": ...} ``` instead of clean JSON
  - **Root Cause**: These models interpret JSON format requests as markdown-formatted responses, but OpenAI service only did direct JSON parsing
  - **Solution**: Added three-tier fallback parsing: direct JSON ‚Üí markdown code block extraction ‚Üí regex JSON search
  - **Benefits**: Now handles both clean JSON (other models) and markdown-wrapped JSON (problematic models) seamlessly
  - **Compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality while adding resilience for edge-case model behaviors

### Technical Implementation
- **Enhanced JSON Parsing**: Added markdown code block detection with regex `/```(?:json\s*)?([^`]*?)```/s`
- **Fallback Strategy**: Similar to Anthropic service's robust JSON extraction approach
- **Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to track parsing attempts and identify future format changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation through multiple parsing strategies

### UI Enhancements (Code by Cascade)
- **Raw DB Record Toggle**: `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultCard.tsx` now includes a header toggle to show/hide the raw explanation database record (pretty‚Äëprinted JSON). Useful for debugging provider parsing vs stored values. Non-intrusive ghost button; collapsible, scrollable panel.
- **Predicted Answer(s) Display**: `AnalysisResultCard` renders model-predicted grid(s) when available (`predictedOutputGrid` or `predictedOutputGrids[]`), with an optional extraction method badge. Uses `PuzzleGrid` with numeric view.
- **Correct Answer Grid**: `AnalysisResultCard` now shows the correct output grid from the task file (first test by default), passed from `PuzzleExaminer.tsx` via `expectedOutputGrid`.
- **Compact Diff Overlay**: Added mismatch indicators (small red dots) on predicted grid cells that differ from the correct grid. Implemented via `diffMask` in `PuzzleGrid` and `mismatch` in `GridCell`.
  - Enhancement: Replaced corner dot with a centered high‚Äëcontrast bullseye marker for better visibility across all cell colors.
  - Placement: Correctness badge moved to the "Model Predicted Answer" panel to clarify comparison direction.
  - Control: Added a "Diff overlay: On/Off" toggle to enable/disable mismatch markers on the predicted grid.

### Multi‚ÄëTest Support Improvements (Code by Cascade)
- **Prompt Builder**: `server/services/promptBuilder.ts` now includes ALL test cases in prompts. Solver mode instructs models to return `predictedOutputs` (array) for multi-test tasks, with backward-compatible `predictedOutput` for single-test.
- **Validator**: `server/services/responseValidator.ts` adds `validateSolverResponseMulti()` and multi-grid extraction to validate arrays of predicted outputs against multiple expected outputs, computing per-test and average scores.
- **Controller Wiring**: `server/controllers/puzzleController.ts` routes multi-test tasks through the new multi-test validator and returns `predictedOutputGrids`, `multiValidation`, `allPredictionsCorrect`, and `averagePredictionAccuracyScore` fields.
- **BC Compatibility**: Single-test behavior unchanged; existing consumers continue to receive `predictedOutputGrid` and related fields.

## Version 1.4.5 ‚Äî OpenAI Response Parsing Fixes (2025-08-21)

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **OpenAI Reasoning Log Parsing (Code by Claude Code)**: Fixed broken reasoning log display showing `[object Object]` instead of actual reasoning content
  - **Root Cause**: Summary array objects not being properly parsed - was calling `s?.text` on objects that had different structure
  - **Fix Applied**: Enhanced object parsing to handle multiple summary object structures (`s.text`, `s.content`, fallback to JSON.stringify)
  - **Content Type Recognition**: Added support for `output_text` content type in OpenAI's response blocks
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing string and array parsing while adding robust object handling
- **Response Extraction Enhancement (Code by Claude Code)**: Improved OpenAI response text extraction from complex output blocks
  - **Multiple Content Types**: Now recognizes both `text` and `output_text` content types from OpenAI Responses API

  - **Fix**: Normalized confidence to integer percent (0‚Äì100) in both Saturn Responses and Visual paths.
    - Updated `server/services/saturnVisualService.ts`:
      - `calculateConfidenceFromReasoning()` now returns clamped integer percent.
      - Final event handler now converts 0..1 confidences to 0..100 before persistence.
  - **Result**: DB inserts succeed; UI and stats continue to read integer confidence values.

  - **Solution**: Added missing 'GET' method parameter: `apiRequest('GET', url)` instead of `apiRequest(url)`
  - **Secondary Fix**: Corrected response parsing by adding `await response.json()` before accessing `.data` property
- **Result**: Puzzle overview page now successfully loads and displays all puzzles with explanation status, filtering, and pagination

### Investigation Process
- Verified frontend component structure and routing configuration
- Confirmed backend API endpoint `/api/puzzle/overview` exists and functions correctly
- Identified `apiRequest()` function signature mismatch through systematic debugging
- Server logs showed successful 200 responses, confirming issue was client-side

## Version 1.3.3 ‚Äî Saturn Visual Solver & Railway Fixes (2025-08-15)

### Features
- __Saturn Visual Solver (Code by Cascade)__: New page that streams phased visual analysis with intermediate images and a model selector. Includes a visible banner crediting the Saturn ARC project with a GitHub link.
- __Frontend Hook__: `client/src/hooks/useSaturnProgress.ts` accumulates streamed images and progress events for live UI updates.
- __Provider-Aware Image Delivery (Code by Cascade)__: `solver/arc_visual_solver.py` now enforces provider-specific image delivery; OpenAI path uses base64 PNG data URLs. No silent fallback; unsupported providers raise a clear error.

### Deployment Fixes (Railway Docker)
- __Python Runtime__: Dockerfile now installs Python 3 (`apk add python3 py3-pip`).
- __PEP 668 Compliance__: Uses `pip --break-system-packages` during build to allow installing `requirements.txt` on Alpine.
- __Include Solver Code__: Added `COPY solver/ ./solver/` so `server/python/saturn_wrapper.py` can import `arc_visual_solver`.
- __Python Binary Detection__: `server/services/pythonBridge.ts` auto-selects `python` on Windows and `python3` on Linux; still respects `PYTHON_BIN` env override.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed local Windows error ‚ÄúPython was not found‚Äù by defaulting to `python` on `win32`.
- Fixed Railway build failure ‚Äúexternally-managed-environment‚Äù by adding `--break-system-packages`.
- Fixed runtime error ‚ÄúNo module named 'arc_visual_solver'‚Äù by copying the `solver/` directory and ensuring `sys.path` includes it in `saturn_wrapper.py`.

### Touched Files
- `Dockerfile`
- `server/services/pythonBridge.ts`
- `server/python/saturn_wrapper.py`
- `server/controllers/saturnController.ts`
- `server/services/saturnVisualService.ts`
- `client/src/pages/SaturnVisualSolver.tsx`
- `client/src/hooks/useSaturnProgress.ts`
- `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx`
- `solver/arc_visual_solver.py`

### Backend Notes (Saturn)
- Python wrapper now accepts `options.provider`/`options.model` and constructs the solver accordingly. Unsupported providers emit an `error` event and abort.
- Images sent to the model are always base64-encoded PNG data URLs.

### Credits
- Implementation: **Cascade** with GPT-5 medium reasoning and Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking

## Version 1.3.2 ‚Äî Prompt Default, Preview, and Solver Template (2025-08-14)

### Features
- **Default Prompt Selection (UI)**: `PromptPicker` now defaults to "Custom Prompt" with an empty textarea. Researchers can enter a prompt or switch to a template before analyzing.
- **Provider-Specific Prompt Preview**:
  - Backend: `POST /api/prompt/preview/:provider/:puzzleId` returns the exact assembled prompt string for the selected provider and inputs.
  - Frontend: A preview modal in `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx` shows the precise prompt that will be sent. When using Custom Prompt, the modal supports in-place editing and sending.
- **New "Solver" Prompt Template**: Sends puzzle data without the correct answer and asks the AI to predict the answer and explain its reasoning. Uses the same JSON response schema as explanation mode for seamless display.

### Fixes
- **Custom Prompt Purity**: Resolved an issue where template instructions were appended to custom prompts. Custom runs now send only the user's text plus raw puzzle data (no template wrapping).

### Touched Files
- `client/src/components/PromptPreviewModal.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx`
- `server/services/promptBuilder.ts`
- `shared/types.ts`

### Credits
- Implementation: **Cascade**

## Version 1.3.1 ‚Äî UI/UX and Performance Enhancements (2025-08-13)

### Features & Enhancements
- **Collapsible Mission Statement (Code by Cascade)**: Replaced the large block of text on the landing page with a collapsible mission statement, creating a cleaner and more focused UI.
- **Default to Unexplained Puzzles (Code by Cascade)**: The puzzle browser now defaults to showing unexplained puzzles first, helping users focus on puzzles that need attention.

### Performance Optimizations
- **N+1 Query Fix (Code by Cascade)**: Implemented a bulk database query (`getBulkExplanationStatus`) to fetch explanation statuses for all puzzles at once, drastically reducing puzzle list load times.

### Bug Fixes
- **Puzzle Filter Logic (Code by Cascade)**: Corrected the server-side sorting logic to ensure that prioritizing unexplained puzzles works as intended. The logic is now handled in `puzzleService` after data enrichment.
- **Puzzle Examiner Toggle (Code by Cascade)**:
    - Slowed down the animation for the color/emoji toggle for a smoother user experience.
    - Fixed the toggle's text to accurately reflect its state.
    - Set the default view to colors (Standard Explanation).

### Credits
- All changes in this version were implemented by **Cascade**.

## Version 1.3.0 ‚Äî Prompt Architecture Refactor (2025-08-12)

### Major Architectural Changes
- __Centralized Prompt Builder (Code by Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking)__: Created `server/services/promptBuilder.ts` as single source of truth for all prompt construction and emoji mapping logic.
- __Modular Emoji System__: Emoji mapping now only applies to the "Alien Communication" prompt template. All other prompts use raw numeric grids by default.
- __Service Unification__: Refactored all 5 backend AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek) to use shared prompt builder, eliminating code duplication.

### Breaking Changes
- __Default Behavior Change__: Changed default `promptId` from `"alienCommunication"` to `"standardExplanation"` across all services, ensuring numeric grids are sent by default.
- __Emoji Mapping Scope__: Emoji mapping is now exclusively for the "Alien Communication" template, preventing unintended emoji usage in custom prompts and other templates.

### Backend Improvements
- Removed 200+ lines of duplicated prompt construction code across AI services.
- Consolidated emoji mapping logic into shared utility functions.
- Improved type safety with consistent prompt template handling.
- Fixed Gemini API integration issues with proper `generateContent` usage.

### Architecture Benefits
- __Single Source of Truth__: All prompt logic centralized in one module for easier maintenance.
- __Consistency__: Uniform prompt behavior across all AI providers.
- __Maintainability__: Future prompt changes only require updates in one location.
- __Reliability__: Eliminated risk of inconsistent emoji mapping behavior.

### Credits
- Architecture and implementation: __Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking__
- All code changes follow established patterns and maintain backward compatibility.

## Version 1.2.0 ‚Äî Custom Prompts & Stability (2025-08-12)

### Features
- __Custom Prompt Support (Code by Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking)__: Researchers can override built‚Äëin templates per analysis run.
- __Provider Coverage__: Works across OpenAI, Grok (xAI), Gemini, DeepSeek, and Anthropic.

### Backend
- Extended `POST /api/puzzle/analyze/:puzzleId/:modelKey` to accept optional `customPrompt` alongside `temperature` and `promptId`.
- Preserves backward compatibility: when `customPrompt` is omitted, templates work as before.
- Training examples and test cases are always appended server‚Äëside.

### Frontend
- `PromptPicker` adds a "Custom Prompt" option with textarea, guidance, and char counter.
- `useAnalysisResults` passes `customPrompt` when `promptId` is `"custom"`.

### Bug fixes
- Prevented null access on `selectedTemplate.emojiMapIncluded` across all AI services when using custom prompts.

### Docs
- README updated with a Researcher Guide, API changes, provider notes, limitations, and troubleshooting.
- Credits: Code authored by __Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking__. Documentation by __GPT-5 (low reasoning)__.

### Notes
- Emoji maps are included only via templates; custom prompts must include their own legend if needed.
- Provider constraints (e.g., temperature or reasoning log availability) still apply.
